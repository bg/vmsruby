TODO, In no particular order:

- bring up-to-date (1.8.7 at least, 1.9.x later?)
- finish port to Itanium
- better filepath handling (natively use Unix paths and provide path
  conversion Unix <-> VMS)
- separate out local (Dymaxion-only) bits from standard MRI bits
- separate out non-core-ruby bits (rspec, rails, etc.)
- support gems
- distinguish between truly arch-specific and compiler-specific
  patches
- replace ad-hoc build system with a sane one
- ensure VMS patches are sent upstream (reinstating VMS as an
  officially supported port)
