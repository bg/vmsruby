#       resource.wait(mutex)

#     }
#   }
#   
#   b = Thread.new {
#     mutex.synchronize {
#       # Thread 'b' has finished using the resource
#       resource.signal
#     }
#   }

# Documentation comments:
#  - SizedQueue #push and #pop deserve some documentation, as they are different
#    from the Queue implementations.
#  - Some methods are not documented in Pickaxe/Nutshell, and are therefore not
#    documented here.  See FIXME notes.
#  - Reference to Pickaxe page numbers should be replaced with either a section
#    name or a summary.
#  - How do you document aliases?
#  - How do you make RDoc inherit documentation from superclass?
