integration_test. 4914 [Frederick Ros &lt;sl33p3r@free.fr&gt;]

</li>
<li><a
href="../../../../classes/ActionController/Base.html">ActionController::Base</a>
Summary documentation rewrite. 4900 [kevin.clark@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fix text_helper.rb documentation rendering. 4725 [Frederick Ros]

</li>
<li>Fixes bad rendering of JavaScriptMacrosHelper rdoc. 4910 [Frederick Ros]

</li>
<li>Enhance documentation for setting headers in integration tests. Skip auto
HTTP prepending when its already there. 4079 [Rick Olson]

</li>
<li>Documentation for AbstractRequest. 4895 [kevin.clark@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Remove all remaining references to @params in the documentation. [Marcel
Molina Jr.]

</li>
<li>Add documentation for redirect_to :back&#8217;s RedirectBackError
exception. [Marcel Molina Jr.]

</li>
<li>Update layout and content_for documentation to use yield rather than magic
@content_for instance variables. [Marcel Molina Jr.]

</li>
<li>Cache CgiRequest#request_parameters so that multiple calls don&#8217;t
re-parse multipart data. [Rick]

</li>
<li>Fixed that remote_form_for can leave out the object parameter and default
to the instance variable of the object_name, just like form_for [DHH]

</li>
<li>Added ActionController.filter_parameter_logging that makes it easy to
remove passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information from
being logged when a request is handled. 1897 [jeremye@bsa.ca.gov]

</li>
<li>Fixed that real files and symlinks should be treated the same when

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.12.3* (June 28th, 2006)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix broken traverse_to_controller. We now: Look for a _controller.rb file
under RAILS_ROOT to load. If we find it, we require_dependency it and
return the controller it defined. (If none was defined we stop looking.) If
we don&#8217;t find it, we look for a .rb file under RAILS_ROOT to load. If
we find it, and it loads a constant we keep looking. Otherwise we check to
see if a directory of the same name exists, and if it does we create a
module for it.

</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>Refinement to avoid exceptions in traverse_to_controller.

</ul>
<p>

same actions. 4522 [Marcel Molina Jr.]

</li>
<li>Delegate xml_http_request in integration tests to the session instance.
[Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Update the diagnostics template skip the useless &#8217;&lt;controller not

</li>
<li>CHANGED DEFAULT: Don&#8216;t parse YAML input by default, but keep it
available as an easy option [DHH]

</li>
<li>Add additional autocompleter options [aballai, Thomas Fuchs]

</li>
<li>Fixed fragment caching of binary data on Windows 4493
[bellis@deepthought.org]

</li>
<li>Applied Prototype $() performance patches (4465, 4477) and updated
script.aculo.us [Sam Stephenson, Thomas Fuchs]

</li>
<li>Added automated timestamping to AssetTagHelper methods for stylesheets,
javascripts, and images when Action Controller is run under Rails [DHH].
Example:

<pre>
  image_tag(&quot;rails.png&quot;) # =&gt; '&lt;img alt=&quot;Rails&quot; src=&quot;/images/rails.png?1143664135&quot; /&gt;'
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;to avoid frequent stats (not a problem for most people), you can set
RAILS_ASSET_ID in the ENV to avoid stats:
</p>
<pre>
  ENV[&quot;RAILS_ASSET_ID&quot;] = &quot;2345&quot;
  image_tag(&quot;rails.png&quot;) # =&gt; '&lt;img alt=&quot;Rails&quot; src=&quot;/images/rails.png?2345&quot; /&gt;'
</pre>
<p>
This can be used by deployment managers to set the asset id by application
revision
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.12.0* (March 27th, 2006)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Add documentation for respond_to. [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Fixed require of bluecloth and redcloth when gems haven&#8217;t been loaded
4446 [murphy@cYcnus.de]

</li>
<li>Update to Prototype 1.5.0_pre1 [Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Change form_for and fields_for so that the second argument is not required
[Dave Thomas]

<pre>
  &lt;% form_for :post, @post, :url =&gt; { :action =&gt; 'create' } do |f| -%&gt;
</pre>
<p>
becomes&#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;% form_for :post, :url =&gt; { :action =&gt; 'create' } do |f| -%&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Update to script.aculo.us 1.6 [Thomas Fuchs]

</li>
<li>Enable application/x-yaml processing by default [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Fix double url escaping of remote_function. Add :escape =&gt; false option
to ActionView&#8217;s url_for. [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Add :script option to in_place_editor to support evalScripts (closes 4194)
[codyfauser@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fix mixed case enumerable methods in the JavaScript Collection Proxy
(closes 4314) [codyfauser@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Undo accidental escaping for mail_to; add regression test. [Nicholas
Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added nicer message for assert_redirected_to (closes 4294) [court3nay]

<pre>
  assert_redirected_to :action =&gt; 'other_host', :only_path =&gt; false
</pre>
<p>
when it was expecting&#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  redirected_to :action =&gt; 'other_host', :only_path =&gt; true, :host =&gt; 'other.test.host'
</pre>
<p>
gives the error message&#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  response is not a redirection to all of the options supplied (redirection is &lt;{:only_path=&gt;false, :host=&gt;&quot;other.test.host&quot;, :action=&gt;&quot;other_host&quot;}&gt;), difference: &lt;{:only_path=&gt;&quot;true&quot;, :host=&gt;&quot;other.test.host&quot;}&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Change url_for to escape the resulting URLs when called from a view.
[Nicholas Seckar, coffee2code]

</li>
<li>Added easy support for testing file uploads with fixture_file_upload 4105
[turnip@turnipspatch.com]. Example:

<pre>
  # Looks in Test::Unit::TestCase.fixture_path + '/files/spongebob.png'
  post :change_avatar, :avatar =&gt; fixture_file_upload('/files/spongebob.png', 'image/png')
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed UrlHelper#current_page? to behave even when url-escaped entities are
present 3929 [jeremy@planetargon.com]

</li>
<li>Add ability for relative_url_root to be specified via an environment
variable RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT. [isaac@reuben.com, Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed link_to &quot;somewhere&quot;, :post =&gt; true to produce valid
XHTML by using the parentnode instead of document.body for the instant form
3007 [Bob Silva]

</li>
<li>Added :function option to PrototypeHelper#observe_field/observe_form that
allows you to call a function instead of submitting an ajax call as the
trigger 4268 [jonathan@daikini.com]

</li>
<li>Make Mime::Type.parse consider q values (if any) [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>XML-formatted requests are typecast according to &quot;type&quot;
attributes for :xml_simple [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added protection against proxy setups treating requests as local even when
they&#8217;re not 3898 [stephen_purcell@yahoo.com]

</li>
<li>Added TestRequest#raw_post that simulate raw_post from CgiRequest 3042
[francois.beausoleil@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Underscore dasherized keys in formatted requests [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Add MimeResponds::Responder#any for managing multiple types with identical
responses [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Make the xml_http_request testing method set the HTTP_ACCEPT header [Jamis
Buck]

</li>
<li>Add Verification to scaffolds. Prevent destructive actions using GET
[Michael Koziarski]

</li>
<li>Avoid hitting the filesystem when using layouts by using a File.directory?
cache. [Stefan Kaes, Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Simplify <a
href="../../../../classes/ActionController/Base.html#M000198">ActionController::Base#controller_path</a>
[Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added simple alert() notifications for RJS exceptions when
config.action_view.debug_rjs = true. [Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Added :content_type option to render, so you can change the content type on
the fly [DHH]. Example: render :action =&gt; &quot;atom.rxml&quot;,
:content_type =&gt; &quot;application/atom+xml&quot;

</li>
<li>CHANGED DEFAULT: The default content type for .rxml is now application/xml
instead of type/xml, see <a
href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/07/21/dive.html">www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/07/21/dive.html</a>
for reason [DHH]

</li>
<li>Added option to render action/template/file of a specific extension (and
here by template type). This means you can have multiple templates with the
same name but a different extension [DHH]. Example:

<pre>
  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    def index
      @posts = Post.find :all

      respond_to do |type|
        type.html # using defaults, which will render weblog/index.rhtml
        type.xml  { render :action =&gt; &quot;index.rxml&quot; }
        type.js   { render :action =&gt; &quot;index.rjs&quot; }
      end
    end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added better support for using the same actions to output for different
sources depending on the Accept header [DHH]. Example:

<pre>
  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    def create
      @post = Post.create(params[:post])

      respond_to do |type|
        type.js   { render }  # renders create.rjs
        type.html { redirect_to :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; }
        type.xml  do
          headers[&quot;Location&quot;] = url_for(:action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;, :id =&gt; @post)
          render(:nothing, :status =&gt; &quot;201 Created&quot;)
        end
      end
    end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base#render(:xml =&gt; xml) that works just like Base#render(:text
=&gt; text), but sets the content-type to text/xml and the charset to UTF-8
[DHH]

</li>
<li>Integration test&#8217;s url_for now runs in the context of the last
request (if any) so after post /products/show/1 url_for :action =&gt;
&#8216;new&#8217; will yield /product/new [Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Re-added mixed-in helper methods for the JavascriptGenerator. Moved
JavascriptGenerators methods to a module that is mixed in after the helpers
are added. Also fixed that variables set in the enumeration methods like
collect are set correctly. Documentation added for the enumeration methods
[Rick Olson]. Examples:

<pre>
  page.select('#items li').collect('items') do |element|
    element.hide
  end
  # =&gt; var items = $$('#items li').collect(function(value, index) { return value.hide(); });
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added plugin support for parameter parsers, which allows for better support
for REST web services. By default, posts submitted with the application/xml
content type is handled by creating a XmlSimple hash with the same name as
the root element of the submitted xml. More handlers can easily be
registered like this:

<pre>
  # Assign a new param parser to a new content type
  ActionController::Base.param_parsers['application/atom+xml'] = Proc.new do |data|
    node = REXML::Document.new(post)
   { node.root.name =&gt; node.root }
  end

  # Assign the default XmlSimple to a new content type
  ActionController::Base.param_parsers['application/backpack+xml'] = :xml_simple
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Default YAML web services were retired,
ActionController::Base.param_parsers carries an example which shows how to
get this functionality back. As part of this new plugin support,
request.[formatted_post?, xml_post?, yaml_post? and post_format] were all
deprecated in favor of request.content_type [Tobias Luetke]
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Effect.Appear in effects.js to work with floats in Safari 3524, 3813,
3044 [Thomas Fuchs]

</li>
<li>Fixed that default image extension was not appended when using a full URL
with AssetTagHelper#image_tag 4032, 3728 [rubyonrails@beautifulpixel.com]

</li>
<li>Added that page caching will only happen if the response code is less than
400 4033 [g.bucher@teti.ch]

</li>
<li>Add <a
href="../../../../classes/ActionController/IntegrationTest.html">ActionController::IntegrationTest</a>
to allow high-level testing of the way the controllers and routes all work
together [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added support to AssetTagHelper#javascript_include_tag for having :defaults
appear anywhere in the list, so you can now make one call ala
javascript_include_tag(:defaults, &quot;my_scripts&quot;) or
javascript_include_tag(&quot;my_scripts&quot;, :defaults) depending on how
you want the load order 3506 [Bob Silva]

</li>
<li>Added support for visual effects scoped queues to the visual_effect helper
3530 [Abdur-Rahman Advany]

</li>
<li>Added .rxml (and any non-rhtml template, really) supportfor
CaptureHelper#content_for and CaptureHelper#capture 3287 [Brian Takita]

</li>

  page.sortable 'todolist', :url =&gt; { action =&gt; 'change_order' }
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that form elements would strip the trailing [] from the first
parameter 3545 [ruby@bobsilva.com]

</li>
<li>During controller resolution, update the NameError suppression to check for
the expected constant. [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Update script.aculo.us to V1.5.3 [Thomas Fuchs]

</li>
<li>Added various InPlaceEditor options, 3746, 3891, 3896, 3906 [Bill Burcham,
ruairi, sl33p3r]

</li>
<li>Added :count option to pagination that&#8217;ll make it possible for the
ActiveRecord::Base.count call to using something else than * for the count.

</li>
<li>Update script.aculo.us to V1.5.2 [Thomas Fuchs]

</li>
<li>Added element and collection proxies to RJS [DHH]. Examples:

<pre>
  page['blank_slate']                  # =&gt; $('blank_slate');
  page['blank_slate'].show             # =&gt; $('blank_slate').show();
  page['blank_slate'].show('first').up # =&gt; $('blank_slate').show('first').up();

  page.select('p')                      # =&gt; $$('p');
  page.select('p.welcome b').first      # =&gt; $$('p.welcome b').first();
  page.select('p.welcome b').first.hide # =&gt; $$('p.welcome b').first().hide();
</pre>

  class WeblogController &lt; ApplicationController
    # will run the :authenticate filter

<li>Make assert_redirected_to properly check URL&#8217;s passed as strings 1910
[Scott Barron]

</li>
<li>Make sure :layout =&gt; false is always used when rendering inside a layout

</li>
<li>Use raise instead of assert_not_nil in Test::Unit::TestCase#process to
ensure that the test variables (controller, request, response) have been
set

</li>
<li>Make sure assigns are built for every request when testing 1866

</li>
<li>Allow remote_addr to be queried on TestRequest 1668

</li>
<li>Fixed bug when a partial render was passing a local with the same name as
the partial

</li>
<li>Improved performance of test app req/sec with ~10% refactoring the render
method 1823 [Stefan Kaes]

</li>
<li>Improved performance of test app req/sec with 5-30% through a series of
Action Pack optimizations 1811 [Stefan Kaes]

</li>
<li>Changed caching/expiration/hit to report using the DEBUG log level and
errors to use the ERROR log level instead of both using INFO

</li>
<li>Added support for per-action session management 1763

</li>
<li>Improved rendering speed on complicated templates by up to 100% (the more
complex the templates, the higher the speedup) 1234 [Stephan Kaes]. This
did necessasitate a change to the internals of ActionView#render_template
that now has four parameters. Developers of custom view handlers (like
Amrita) need to update for that.

</li>
<li>Added options hash as third argument to FormHelper#input, so you can do
input(&#8216;person&#8217;, &#8216;zip&#8217;, :size=&gt;10) 1719
[jeremye@bsa.ca.gov]

</li>
<li>Added Base#expires_in(seconds)/Base#expires_now to control HTTP content
cache headers 1755 [Thomas Fuchs]

</li>
<li>Fixed line number reporting for Builder template errors 1753 [piotr]

</li>
<li>Fixed assert_routing so that testing controllers in modules works as
expected [Nicholas Seckar, Rick Olson]

</li>
<li>Fixed bug with :success/:failure callbacks for the JavaScriptHelper methods
1730 [court3nay/Thomas Fuchs]

</li>
<li>Added named_route method to RouteSet instances so that RouteSet instance
methods do not prevent certain names from being used. [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed routes so that routes which do not specify :action in the path or in
the requirements have a default of :action =&gt; &#8216;index&#8217;, In
addition, fixed url generation so that :action =&gt; &#8216;index&#8217;
does not need to be provided for such urls. [Nicholas Seckar, Markjuh]

</li>
<li>Worked around a Safari bug where it wouldn&#8217;t pass headers through if
the response was zero length by having render :nothing return &#8217;
&#8217; instead of &#8217;&#8217;

</li>
<li>Fixed Request#subdomains to handle &quot;foo.foo.com&quot; correctly

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.9.1* (11 July, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed that auto_complete_for didn&#8217;t force the input string to lower
case even as the db comparison was

</li>
<li>Fixed that Action View should always use the included Builder, never
attempt to require the gem, to ensure compatibility

</li>
<li>Added that nil options are not included in tags, so tag(&quot;p&quot;,
:ignore =&gt; nil) now returns &lt;p /&gt; not &lt;p ignore=&quot;&quot;
/&gt; but that tag(&quot;p&quot;, :ignore =&gt; &quot;&quot;) still
includes it 1465 [michael@schuerig.de]

</li>
<li>Fixed that UrlHelper#link_to_unless/link_to_if used html_escape on the name
if no link was to be applied. This is unnecessary and breaks its use with
images 1649 [joergd@pobox.com]

</li>
<li>Improved error message for DoubleRenderError

</li>
<li>Fixed routing to allow for testing of *path components 1650 [Nicholas
Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added :handle as an option to sortable_element to restrict the drag handle
to a given class 1642 [thejohnny]

</li>
<li>Added a bunch of script.aculo.us features 1644, 1677, 1695 [Thomas Fuchs]

<ul>
<li>Effect.ScrollTo, to smoothly scroll the page to an element

</li>
<li>Better Firefox flickering handling on SlideUp/SlideDown

</li>
<li>Removed a possible memory leak in IE with draggables

</li>
<li>Added support for cancelling dragging my hitting ESC

</li>
<li>Added capability to remove draggables/droppables and redeclare sortables in
dragdrop.js (this makes it possible to call sortable_element on the same
element more than once, e.g. in AJAX returns that modify the sortable
element. all current sortable &#8216;stuff&#8217; on the element will be
discarded and the sortable will be rebuilt)

</li>
<li>Always reset background color on Effect.Highlight; this make change
backwards-compatibility, to be sure include
style=&quot;background-color:(target-color)&quot; on your elements or else
elements will fall back to their CSS rules (which is a good thing in most
circumstances)

</li>
<li>Removed circular references from element to prevent memory leaks (still not
completely gone in IE)

</li>
<li>Changes to class extension in effects.js

</li>
<li>Make Effect.Highlight restore any previously set background color when
finishing (makes effect work with CSS classes that set a background color)

</li>
<li>Fixed myriads of memory leaks in IE and Gecko-based browsers [David Zülke]

</li>
<li>Added incremental and local autocompleting and loads of documentation to
controls.js [Ivan Krstic]

</li>
<li>Extended the auto_complete_field helper to accept tokens option

</li>
<li>Changed object extension mechanism to favor Object.extend to make
script.aculo.us easily adaptable to support 3rd party libs like IE7.js
[David Zülke]

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed that named routes didn&#8217;t use the default values for action and
possible other parameters 1534 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed JavascriptHelper#visual_effect to use camelize such that :blind_up
will work 1639 [pelletierm@eastmedia.net]

</li>
<li>Fixed that a SessionRestoreError was thrown if a model object was placed in
the session that wasn&#8217;t available to all controllers. This means that
it&#8217;s no longer necessary to use the &#8216;model :post&#8217;
work-around in ApplicationController to have a Post model in your session.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.9.0* (6 July, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added logging of the request URI in the benchmark statement (makes it easy
to grep for slow actions)

</li>
<li>Added javascript_include_tag :defaults shortcut that&#8217;ll include all
the default javascripts included with Action Pack (prototype, effects,
controls, dragdrop)

</li>
<li>Cache several controller variables that are expensive to calculate 1229
[skaes@web.de]

</li>
<li>The session class backing CGI::Session::ActiveRecordStore may be replaced
with any class that duck-types with a subset of Active Record. See docs for
details 1238 [skaes@web.de]

</li>
<li>Fixed that hashes was not working properly when passed by GET to lighttpd
849 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed assert_template nil will be true when no template was rendered 1565
[maceywj@telus.net]

</li>
<li>Added :prompt option to FormOptions#select (and the users of it, like
FormOptions#select_country etc) to create &quot;Please select&quot; style
descriptors 1181 [Michael Schuerig]

</li>
<li>Added JavascriptHelper#update_element_function, which returns a Javascript
function (or expression) that&#8217;ll update a DOM element according to
the options passed 933 [mortonda@dgrmm.net]. Examples:

<pre>
  &lt;%= update_element_function(&quot;products&quot;, :action =&gt; :insert, :position =&gt; :bottom, :content =&gt; &quot;&lt;p&gt;New product!&lt;/p&gt;&quot;) %&gt;

  &lt;% update_element_function(&quot;products&quot;, :action =&gt; :replace, :binding =&gt; binding) do %&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Product 1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Product 2&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added :field_name option to DateHelper#select_(year|month|day) to deviate
from the year/month/day defaults 1266 [Marcel Molina]

</li>
<li>Added JavascriptHelper#draggable_element and
JavascriptHelper#drop_receiving_element to facilitate easy dragging and
dropping through the script.aculo.us libraries 1578 [Thomas Fuchs]

</li>
<li>Added that UrlHelper#mail_to will now also encode the default link title
749 [f.svehla@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Removed the default option of wrap=virtual on FormHelper#text_area to
ensure XHTML compatibility 1300 [thomas@columbus.rr.com]

</li>
<li>Adds the ability to include XML CDATA tags using Builder 1563 [Josh
Knowles]. Example:

<pre>
  xml.cdata! &quot;some text&quot; # =&gt; &lt;![CDATA[some text]]&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added evaluation of &lt;SCRIPT&gt; blocks in content returned to Ajax calls
1577 [Thomas Fuchs/court3nay/Sean Treadway]

</li>
<li>Directly generate paths with a leading slash instead of tacking it on
later. 1543 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed errant parameter modification in functional tests. 1542 [Nicholas
Seckar]

</li>
<li>Routes fail with leading slash 1540 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added support for graceful error handling of Ajax calls 1217 [Jamis
Buck/Thomas Fuchs]. Example:

<pre>
  link_to_remote(
    &quot;test&quot;,
    :url =&gt; { :action =&gt; &quot;faulty&quot; },
    :update =&gt; { :success =&gt; &quot;good&quot;, :failure =&gt; &quot;bad&quot; },
    403 =&gt; &quot;alert('Forbidden- got ya!')&quot;,
    404 =&gt; &quot;alert('Nothing there...?')&quot;,
    :failure =&gt; &quot;alert('Unkown error ' + request.status)&quot;)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Attempt to explicitly flush the output at the end of CgiProcess#out

</li>
<li>Fixed assert_redirected_to to handle absolute controller paths properly
1472 [Rick Olson/Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added event-based observations when frequency is not set on
observe_field/form 1474 [flash@vanklinkenbergsoftware.nl]

</li>
<li>Added script.aculo.us Javascripts (controls.js, dragdrop.js, effects.js)
(NEEDS MORE DESCRIPTION) 1509 [Thomas Fuchs]

</li>
<li>Fixed prototype to consider all fields it doesn&#8217;t know as text (such
as Safari&#8217;s search) just like the browser in its serialization 1497
[Sean Treadway]

</li>
<li>Improved performance of Routes generation by a factor of 5 1434 [Nicholas
Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added named routes (NEEDS BETTER DESCRIPTION) 1434 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Improved AbstractRequest documentation 1483 [court3nay@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Added ActionController::Base.allow_concurrency to control whether the
application is thread-safe, so multi-threaded servers like WEBrick knows
whether to apply a mutex around the performance of each action. Turned off
by default. EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE.

</li>
<li>Added TextHelper#word_wrap(text, line_length = 80) 1449
[tuxie@dekadance.se]

</li>
<li>Added a fall-through action for form_remote_tag that&#8217;ll be used in
case Javascript is unavailable 1459 [Scott Barron]. Example:

<pre>
  form_remote_tag :html =&gt; { :action =&gt; url_for(:controller =&gt; &quot;some&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;place&quot;) }
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added :xhr =&gt; true/false option to verify so you can ensure that a
request is coming from an Ajax call or not 1464 [Thomas Fuchs]

</li>
<li>Added tag_options as a third parameter to
AssetHelper#auto_discovery_link_tag to control options like the title of
the link 1430 [kevin.clark@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Added option to pass in parameters to CaptureHelper#capture, so you can
create more advanced view helper methods 1466 [duane.johnson@gmail.com].
Example:

<pre>
  &lt;% show_calendar(:year =&gt; 2005, :month =&gt; 6) do |day, options| %&gt;
    &lt;% options[:bgcolor] = '#dfd' if 10..15.include? day %&gt;
    [&lt;%= day %&gt;]
  &lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Changed the default name of the input tag generated by
FormTagHelper#submit_tag from &quot;submit&quot; to &quot;commit&quot; so
it doesn&#8217;t clash with form.submit() calls in Javascript 1271

</li>
<li>Fixed relative urls support for lighttpd 1048 [Nicholas
Seckar/maznawak@nerim.net]

</li>
<li>Correct distance_of_time_in_words for integer arguments and make the second
arg optional, treating the first arg as a duration in seconds. 1458
[madrobby &lt;thomas@fesch.at&gt;]

</li>
<li>Fixed query parser to deal gracefully with equal signs inside keys and
values 1345 [gorou]. Example: /?sig=abcdef=:foobar=&amp;x=y will pass now.

</li>
<li>Added Cuba to country list 1351 [todd]

</li>
<li>Fixed radio_button to work with numeric values 1352 [demetrius]

</li>
<li>Added :extension option to NumberHelper#number_to_phone 1361 [delynnb]

</li>
<li>Added button_to as a form-based solution to deal with harmful actions that
should be hidden behind POSTs. This makes it just as easy as link_to to
create a safe trigger for actions like destroy, although it&#8217;s limited
by being a block element, the fixed look, and a no-no inside other forms.
1371 [tom@moertel.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed image_tag so an exception is not thrown just because the image is
missing and alt value can&#8217;t be generated 1395 [Marcel]

</li>
<li>Added a third parameter to TextHelper#auto_link called href_options for
specifying additional tag options on the links generated 1401
[tyler.kovacs@gmail.com]. Example: auto_link(text, :all, { :target =&gt;
&quot;_blank&quot; }) to have all the generated links open in a new window.

</li>
<li>Fixed TextHelper#highlight to return the text, not nil, if the phrase is
blank 1409 [patrick@lenz.sh]

</li>
<li>Fixed TagHelper such that :name and &#8216;name&#8217; keys in the options
doesn&#8217;t result in two attributes 1455 [take_tk]

</li>
<li>Ensure that helpers are only available to the controllers where they are
defined and their subclasses. 1394 [kdole@tamu.edu]

</li>
<li>render(&quot;foo/bar&quot;) works with a layout again

</li>
<li>Fixed double-singularization on scaffolded pagination call (Address would
be turned into Addres) 1216, 1404 [nilsga]

</li>
<li>Removed the require hack used by functional testing to work around an
earlier bug in rake.

</li>
<li>Allow distance_of_time_in_words to work with any value that responds to
to_time (like dates) 969

</li>
<li>Support :render option for :verify 1440 [TobiasLuetke]

</li>
<li>Updated vendor copy of html-scanner lib to 0.5.2, for bug fixes and
optimizations. The :content option may be used as expected&#8212;to find a
tag whose textual content is a particular value&#8212;in assert_tag, now.

</li>
<li>Changed test requests to come from 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1 such that
they don&#8217;t trigger debugging screens on exceptions, but instead call
rescue_action_in_public

</li>
<li>Modernize scaffolding to match the generator: use the new render method and
change style from the warty @params[&quot;id&quot;] to the sleek
params[:id]. 1367

</li>
<li>Include :id in the action generated by the form helper method. Then, for
example, the controller can do Model.find(params[:id]) for both edit and
update actions. Updated scaffolding to take advantage. 1367

</li>
<li>Add assertions with friendly messages to TestCase#process to ensure that
@controller, @request, and @response are set. 1367

</li>
<li>Arrays, hashes sent via multipart posts are converted to strings 1032
[dj@omelia.org, me@julik.nl]

</li>
<li>render(:layout =&gt; true) is a synonym for render(:layout =&gt; nil)

</li>
<li>Make sure the benchmarking render method always returns the output of the
render.

</li>
<li>render(:action), render(:template) and render() are the only three calls
that default to using a layout. All other render calls assume :layout =&gt;
false. This also fixes send_file, which was applying a layout if one
existed for the current action.

</li>
<li>verify with :redirect_to won&#8217;t redirect if a redirect or render has
already been performed 1350

</li>
<li>render(:partial =&gt; true) is identical to the behavior of the deprecated
render_partial()

</li>
<li>Fixed render(:partial =&gt; &quot;&#8230;&quot;) to use an empty Hash for
the local assigns 1365

</li>
<li>Fixed Caching::Fragments::FileStore.delete to not raise an exception if the
delete fails.

</li>
<li>Deprecated all render_* methods in favor of consolidating all rendering
behavior in Base#render(options). This enables more natural use of
combining options, such as layouts. Examples:

<pre>
  +---------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
  | BEFORE                                                        | AFTER                                                 |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
  | render_with_layout &quot;weblog/show&quot;, &quot;200 OK&quot;, &quot;layouts/dialog&quot;  | render :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;, :layout =&gt; &quot;dialog&quot;         |
  | render_without_layout &quot;weblog/show&quot;                           | render :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;, :layout =&gt; false            |
  | render_action &quot;error&quot;, &quot;404 Not Found&quot;                        | render :action =&gt; &quot;error&quot;, :status =&gt; &quot;404 Not Found&quot; |
  | render_template &quot;xml.div('stuff')&quot;, &quot;200 OK&quot;, :rxml           | render :inline =&gt; &quot;xml.div('stuff')&quot;, :type =&gt; :rxml  |
  | render_text &quot;hello world!&quot;                                    | render :text =&gt; &quot;hello world!&quot;                        |
  | render_partial_collection &quot;person&quot;, @people, nil, :a =&gt; 1     | render :partial =&gt; &quot;person&quot;, :collection =&gt; @people,  |
  |                                                               |        :locals =&gt; { :a =&gt; 1 }                         |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
</pre>
</li>
<li>Deprecated redirect_to_path and redirect_to_url in favor of letting
redirect_to do the right thing when passed either a path or url.

</li>
<li>Fixed use of an integer as return code for renders, so render_text
&quot;hello world&quot;, 404 now works 1327

</li>
<li>Fixed assert_redirect_to to work with redirect_to_path 869 [Nicholas
Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed escaping of :method option in remote_form_tag 1218 [Rick Olson]

</li>
<li>Added Serbia and Montenegro to the country_select 1239 [todd@robotcoop.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed Request#remote_ip in testing 1251 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed that compute_public_path should recognize external URLs, so
image_tag(&quot;<img src="http://www.example.com/images/icon.gif">&quot;)
is not prefixed with the relative url path 1254
[victor-ronr-trac@carotena.net]

</li>
<li>Added support for descending year values in DateHelper#select_year, like
select_year(Date.today, :start_year =&gt; 2005, :end_year =&gt; 1900),
which would count down from 2005 to 1900 instead of the other way 1274
[nwoods@mail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed that FormHelper#checkbox should return a checked checkbox if the
value is the same as checked_value 1286 [Florian Weber]

</li>
<li>Fixed Form.disable in Prototype 1317 [Wintermute]

</li>
<li>Added accessors to logger, params, response, session, flash, and headers
from the view, so you can write &lt;% logger.info &quot;stuff&quot; %&gt;
instead of &lt;% @logger.info &quot;others&quot; %&gt; &#8212; more
consistent with the preferred way of accessing these attributes and
collections from the controller

</li>
<li>Added support for POST data in form of YAML or XML, which is controller
through the Content-Type header. Example request:

<pre>
  Content-Type: application/xml
  &lt;request&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;content&gt;HelloWorld&lt;/content&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/request&gt;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;is the same as:
</p>
<pre>
  Content-Type: application/x-yaml
  ---
  item:
    content: HelloWorld
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;is the same as:
</p>
<pre>
  item[content]=HelloWorld
</pre>
<p>
Which in the end turns into { &quot;item&quot; =&gt; { &quot;content&quot;
=&gt; &quot;HelloWorld&quot; } }. This makes it a lot easier to publish
REST web services on top of your regular actions (as they won&#8217;t
care).
</p>
<p>
Example Curl call:
</p>
<pre>
  curl -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' -d '&lt;request&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;content&gt;KillMeMore&lt;/content&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/request&gt;' http://www.example.com/service
</pre>
<p>
You can query to find out whether a given request came through as one of
these types with:
</p>
<pre>
  - request.post_format? (:url_encoded, :xml or :yaml)
  - request.formatted_post? (for either xml or yaml)
  - request.xml_post?
  - request.yaml_post?
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added bundling of XmlSimple by Maik Schmidt

</li>
<li>Fixed that render_partial_collection should always return a string (and not
sometimes an array, despite &lt;%= %&gt; not caring)

</li>
<li>Added TextHelper#sanitize that can will remove any Javascript handlers,
blocks, and forms from an input of HTML. This allows for use of HTML on
public sites, but still be free of XSS issues. 1277 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Fixed the HTML scanner used by assert_tag where a infinite loop could be
caused by a stray less-than sign in the input 1270 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added functionality to assert_tag, so you can now do tests on the siblings
of a node, to assert that some element comes before or after the element in
question, or just to assert that some element exists as a sibling 1226
[Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added better error handling for regexp caching expiration

</li>
<li>Fixed handling of requests coming from unknown HTTP methods not to kill the
server

</li>
<li>Added that both AssetHelper#stylesheet_link_tag and
AssetHelper#javascript_include_tag now accept an option hash as the last
parameter, so you can do stuff like: stylesheet_link_tag &quot;style&quot;,
:media =&gt; &quot;all&quot;

</li>
<li>Added FormTagHelper#image_submit_tag for making submit buttons that uses
images

</li>
<li>Added ActionController::Base.asset_host that will then be used by all the
asset helpers. This enables you to easily offload static content like
javascripts and images to a separate server tuned just for that.

</li>
<li>Fixed action/fragment caching using the filestore when a directory and a
file wanted to use the same name. Now there&#8217;s a .cache prefix that
sidesteps the conflict 1188 [imbcmdth@hotmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed missing id uniqueness in FormTag#radio_button 1207 [Jarkko]

</li>
<li>Fixed assert_redirected_to to work with :only_path =&gt; false 1204
[Alisdair McDiarmid]

</li>
<li>Fixed render_partial_collection to output an empty string instead of nil
when handed an empty array 1202 [Ryan Carver]

</li>
<li>Improved the speed of regular expression expirations for caching by a
factor of 10 1221 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Removed dumping of template assigns on the rescue page as it would very
easily include a ton of data making page loads take seconds (and the
information was rarely helpful) 1222

</li>
<li>Added BenchmarkHelper that can measure the execution time of a block in a
template and reports the result to the log. Example:

<pre>
  &lt;% benchmark &quot;Notes section&quot; do %&gt;
    &lt;%= expensive_notes_operation %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;

 Will add something like &quot;Notes section (0.345234)&quot; to the log.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added ActionController::Caching::Sweeper as an improved an easier to use
sweeper. The new sweepers work on a single-step approach instead of
two-steps like the old ones. Before

<pre>
  def after_save(record)
    @list = record.is_a?(List) ? record : record.list
  end

  def filter(controller)
    controller.expire_page(:controller =&gt; &quot;lists&quot;, :action =&gt; %w( show public feed ), :id =&gt; @list.id)
    controller.expire_action(:controller =&gt; &quot;lists&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;all&quot;)
    @list.shares.each { |share| controller.expire_page(:controller =&gt; &quot;lists&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;, :id =&gt; share.url_key) }
  end
</pre>
<p>
..after:
</p>
<pre>
  def after_save(record)
    list = record.is_a?(List) ? record : record.list
    expire_page(:controller =&gt; &quot;lists&quot;, :action =&gt; %w( show public feed ), :id =&gt; list.id)
    expire_action(:controller =&gt; &quot;lists&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;all&quot;)
    list.shares.each { |share| expire_page(:controller =&gt; &quot;lists&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;, :id =&gt; share.url_key) }
  end
</pre>
<p>
The new sweepers can also observe on the actions themselves by implementing
methods according to (before|after)_$controller_$action. Example of a
callback that&#8217;ll be called after PagesController#update_title has
been performed:
</p>
<pre>
    def after_pages_update_title
      expire_fragment(%r{pages/#{controller.assigns[&quot;page&quot;].id}/.*})
    end
</pre>
<p>
Note that missing_method is delegated to the controller instance, which is
assigned in a before filter. This means that you can call expire_fragment
instead of @controller.expire_fragment.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added that Fragments#expire_fragment now accepts as a regular expression as
the name thereby deprecating expire_matched_fragments

</li>
<li>Fixed that fragments shouldn&#8217;t use the current host and the path as
part of the key like pages does

</li>
<li>Added conditions to around_filters just like before_filter and after_filter

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.8.1* (20th April, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added xml_http_request/xhr method for simulating XMLHttpRequest in
functional tests 1151 [Sam Stephenson]. Example:

<pre>
  xhr :post, :index
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that Ajax.Base.options.asynchronous wasn&#8217;t being respected in
Ajax.Request (thanks Jon Casey)

</li>
<li>Fixed that :get, :post, and the others should take a flash array as the
third argument just like process 1144 [rails@cogentdude.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with Flash.now

</li>
<li>Fixed stringification on all assigned hashes. The sacrifice is that
assigns[:person] won&#8217;t work in testing. Instead
assigns[&quot;person&quot;] or assigns(:person) must be used. In other
words, the keys of assigns stay strings but we&#8217;ve added a
method-based accessor to appease the need for symbols.

</li>
<li>Fixed that rendering a template would require a connection to the database
1146

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.8.0* (19th April, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added assert_tag and assert_no_tag as a much improved alternative to the
deprecated assert_template_xpath_match 1126 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Deprecated the majority of all the testing assertions and replaced them
with a much smaller core and access to all the collections the old
assertions relied on. That way the regular test/unit assertions can be used
against these. Added documentation about how to use it all.

</li>
<li>Added a wide range of new Javascript effects:

<pre>
  * Effect.Puff zooms the element out and makes it smoothly transparent at the same time, giving a &quot;puff&quot; illusion #996 [thomas@fesch.at]
    After the animation is completed, the display property will be set to none.
    This effect will work on relative and absolute positioned elements.

  * Effect.Appear as the opposite of Effect.Fade #990 [thomas@fesch.at]
    You should return elements with style=&quot;display:none;&quot; or a like class for this to work best and have no chance of flicker.

  * Effect.Squish for scaling down an element and making it disappear at the end #972 [thomas@fesch.at]

  * Effect.Scale for smoothly scaling images or text up and down #972 [thomas@fesch.at]

  * Effect.Fade which smoothly turns opacity from 100 to 0 and then hides the element #960 [thomas@fesch.at]
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Request#xml_http_request? (and an alias xhr?) to that&#8217;ll return
true when the request came from one of the Javascript helper methods
(Ajax). This can be used to give one behavior for modern browsers
supporting Ajax, another to old browsers 1127 [Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Changed render_partial to take local assigns as the second parameter
instead of an explicit object and then the assigns. So the API changes
from:

<pre>
  &lt;%= render_partial &quot;account&quot;, person, &quot;rules&quot; =&gt; regulations.rules %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;to:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;%= render_partial &quot;account&quot;, :account =&gt; person, :rules =&gt; regulations.rules %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The old API will still work, though, and render_partial &quot;account&quot;
will still assume :account =&gt; @account.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added support for web servers that use PATH_INFO instead of REQUEST_URI
like IIS 1014 [BradG/Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added graceful handling of PUT, DELETE, and OPTIONS requests for a complete
coverage of REST functionality 1136 [joshknowles@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed that you can now pass an alternative :href option to
link_to_function/remote in order to point to somewhere other than # if the
javascript fails or is turned off. You can do the same with form_remote_tag
by passing in :action. 1113 [Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Fixed DateHelper to return values on the option tags such that
they&#8217;ll work properly in IE with form_remote_tag 1024 [Scott Raymond]

</li>
<li>Fixed FormTagHelper#check_box to respect checked 1049 [DelynnB]

</li>
<li>Added that render_partial called from a controller will use the action name
as default 828 [Dan Peterson]

</li>
<li>Added Element.toggle, Element.show, and Element.hide to the prototype
javascript library. Toggle.display has been deprecated, but will still work
992 [Lucas Carlson]

</li>
<li>Added that deleting a cookie should not just set it to an empty string but
also instantly expire it 1118 [todd@robotcoop.com]

</li>
<li>Added AssetTagHelper#image_path, AssetTagHelper#javascript_path, and
AssetTagHelper#stylesheet_path 1110 [Larry Halff]

</li>
<li>Fixed url_for(nil) in functional tests 1116 [Alisdair McDiarmid]

</li>
<li>Fixed error handling of broken layouts 1115 [Michael Schubert]

</li>
<li>Added submit_to_remote that allows you to trigger an Ajax form submition at
the click of the submission button, which allows for multiple targets in a
single form through the use of multiple submit buttons 930
[yrashk@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed pagination to work with joins 1034 [scott@sigkill.org]

</li>
<li>Fixed that *rest parameter in map.connect couldn&#8217;t accept an empty
list 1037 [Dee.Zsombor@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Added :confirm option to link_to_remote just like link_to has 1082
[yrashk@fp.org.ua]

</li>
<li>Added minute_step as an option to select_minute (and the helpers that use
it) to jump in larger increments than just 1 minute. At 15, it would return
0, 15, 30, 45 options 1085 [ordwaye@evergreen.edu]

</li>
<li>Fixed that an exception would be thrown when an empty form was submitted
1090 [jan@ulbrich-boerwang.de]

</li>
<li>Moved TextHelper#human_size to NumberHelper#number_to_human_size, but kept
an deprecated alias to the old method name

</li>
<li>Fixed that the content-type for some browsers could include an additional
\r which made wonky things happen 1067 [Thomas Fuchs]

</li>
<li>Fixed that radio buttons shouldn&#8217;t have a default size attribute 1074
[hendrik@mans.de]

</li>
<li>Added ActionView::Helpers::InstanceTag::DEFAULT_RADIO_OPTIONS that contains
a hash of default options for radio buttons 1074 [hendrik@mans.de]

</li>
<li>Fixed that in some circumstances controllers outside of modules may have
hidden ones inside modules. For example, admin/content might have been
hidden by /content. 1075 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added JavascriptHelper#periodically_call_remote in order to create areas of
a page that update automatically at a set interval 945 [Jon Tirsen]

</li>
<li>Fixed Cache#expire_matched_fragments that couldn&#8217;t recognize the
difference between string and url_for options 1030 [skaes@web.de]

</li>
<li>Added simulation of @request.request_uri in functional tests 1038 [Jamis
Buck]

</li>
<li>Fixed autolinking to work better in more cases 1013 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added the possible of using symbols in form helpers that relate to instance
variables like text_field :account, :name in addition to text_field
&quot;account&quot;, &quot;name&quot;&#8217;

</li>
<li>Fixed javascript_include_tag to output type instead of language and conform
to XHTML 1018 [Rick Olson]

</li>
<li>Added NumberHelper for common string representations like phone number,
currency, and percentage 1015 [DeLynn]

</li>
<li>Added pagination for scaffolding (10 items per page) 964
[mortonda@dgrmm.net]

</li>
<li>Added assert_no_cookie and fixed assert_cookie_equal to deal with
non-existing cookies 979 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed :overwrite_param so it doesn&#8217;t delete but reject elements from
@request.parameters 982 [raphinou@yahoo.com]

</li>
<li>Added :method option to verify for ensuring that either GET, POST, etc is
allowed 984 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added options to set cc, bcc, subject, and body for UrlHelper#mail_to 966
[DeLynn]

</li>
<li>Fixed include_blank for select_hour/minute/second 527 [edward@debian.org]

</li>
<li>Improved the message display on the exception handler pages 963 [Johan
Sorensen]

</li>
<li>Fixed that on very rare occasions, webrick would raise a NoMethodError:
private method &#8216;split&#8217; called for nil 1001 [Flurin Egger]

</li>
<li>Fixed problem with page caching 958 [Rick Olson]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.7.0* (27th March, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added ActionController::Base.page_cache_extension for setting the page
cache file extension (the default is .html) 903 [Andreas]

</li>
<li>Fixed &quot;bad environment variable value&quot; exception caused by
Safari, Apache, and Ajax calls 918

</li>
<li>Fixed that pagination_helper would ignore :params 947 [Sebastian Kanthak]

</li>
<li>Added :owerwrite_params back to url_for and friends &#8212; it was AWL
since the introduction of Routes 921 [raphinou]

</li>
<li>Added :position option to link_to_remote/form_remote_tag that can be either
:before, :top, :bottom, or :after and specifies where the return from the
method should be inserted 952 [Matthew McCray/Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Added Effect.Highlight to prototype.js to do Yellow Fade Technique (of
37signals&#8217; fame) on any container 952 [Sam Stephenson/courtenay]

</li>
<li>Added include_seconds option as the third parameter to
distance_of_time_in_words which will render &quot;less than a minute&quot;
in higher resolution (&quot;less than 10 seconds&quot; etc) 944
[thomas@fesch.at]

</li>
<li>Added fourth option to process in test cases to specify the content of the
flash 949 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added Verifications that allows you to specify preconditions to actions in
form of statements like <tt>verify :only =&gt; :update_post, :params =&gt;
&quot;admin_privileges&quot;, :redirect_to =&gt; { :action =&gt;
&quot;settings&quot; }</tt>, which ensure that the update_post action is
only called if admin_privileges is available as a parameter &#8212;
otherwise the user is redirected to settings. 897 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Fixed Form.Serialize for the JavascriptHelper to also seriliaze password
fields 934 [dweitzman@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Added JavascriptHelper#escape_javascript as a public method (was private)
and made it escape both single and double quotes and new lines 940
[mortonda@dgrmm.net]

</li>
<li>Added trailing_slash option to url_for, so you can generate urls ending in
a slash. Note that is currently not recommended unless you need it for
special reasons since it breaks caching 937 [stian@grytoyr.net]

</li>
<li>Added expire_matched_fragments(regular_expression) to clear out a lot of
fragment caches at once 927 [technoweenie@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed the problems with : and ? in file names for fragment caches on
Windows 927 [technoweenie@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Added TextHelper#human_size for formatting file sizes, like
human_size(1234567) =&gt; 1.2 MB 943 [thomas@fesch.at]

</li>
<li>Fixed link_to :confirm 936 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Improved error reporting especially around never shallowing exceptions.
Debugging helpers should be much easier now 980 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed Toggle.display in prototype.js 902 [Lucas Carlson]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.6.0* (22th March, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a JavascriptHelper and accompanying prototype.js library that opens
the world of Ajax to Action Pack with a large array of options for
dynamically interacting with an application without reloading the page 884
[Sam Stephenson/David]

</li>
<li>Added pagination support through both a controller and helper add-on 817
[Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Fixed routing and helpers to make Rails work on non-vhost setups 826
[Nicholas Seckar/Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Added a much improved Flash module that allows for finer-grained control on
expiration and allows you to flash the current action 839 [Caio Chassot].
Example of flash.now:

<pre>
  class SomethingController &lt; ApplicationController
    def save
      ...
      if @something.save
        # will redirect, use flash
        flash[:message] = 'Save successful'
        redirect_to :action =&gt; 'list'
      else
        # no redirect, message is for current action, use flash.now
        flash.now[:message] = 'Save failed, review'
        render_action 'edit'
      end
    end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added to_param call for parameters when composing an url using url_for from
something else than strings 812 [Sam Stephenson]. Example:

<pre>
  class Page
    def initialize(number)
      @number = number
    end
    # ...
    def to_param
      @number.to_s
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
You can now use instances of Page with url_for:
</p>
<pre>
  class BarController &lt; ApplicationController
    def baz
      page = Page.new(4)
      url = url_for :page =&gt; page # =&gt; &quot;http://foo/bar/baz?page=4&quot;
    end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed form helpers to query Model#id_before_type_cast instead of Model#id
as a temporary workaround for Ruby 1.8.2 warnings 818 [DeLynn B]

</li>
<li>Fixed TextHelper#markdown to use blank? instead of empty? so it can deal
with nil strings passed 814 [Johan Sörensen]

</li>
<li>Added TextHelper#simple_format as a non-dependency text presentation helper
814 [Johan Sörensen]

</li>
<li>Added that the html options disabled, readonly, and multiple can all be
treated as booleans. So specifying <tt>disabled =&gt; :true</tt> will give
<tt>disabled=&quot;disabled&quot;</tt>. 809 [mindel]

</li>
<li>Added path collection syntax for Routes that will gobble up the rest of the
url and pass it on to the controller 830 [rayners]. Example:

<pre>
  map.connect 'categories/*path_info', :controller =&gt; 'categories', :action =&gt; 'show'
</pre>
<p>
A request for /categories/top-level-cat, would give @params[:path_info]
with &quot;top-level-cat&quot;. A request for
/categories/top-level-cat/level-1-cat, would give @params[:path_info] with
&quot;top-level-cat/level-1-cat&quot; and so forth.
</p>
<p>
The @params[:path_info] return is really an array, but where to_s has been
overwritten to do join(&quot;/&quot;).
</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed options_for_select on selected line issue 624 [Florian Weber]

</li>
<li>Added CaptureHelper with CaptureHelper#capture and
CaptureHelper#content_for. See documentation in helper 837 [Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Fixed :anchor use in url_for 821 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Removed the reliance on PATH_INFO as it was causing problems for caching
and inhibited the new non-vhost support 822 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added assigns shortcut for @response.template.assigns to controller test
cases [Jeremy Kemper]. Example:

<p>
Before:
</p>
<pre>
  def test_list
    assert_equal 5, @response.template.assigns['recipes'].size
    assert_equal 8, @response.template.assigns['categories'].size
  end
</pre>
<p>
After:
</p>
<pre>
  def test_list
    assert_equal 5, assigns(:recipes).size
    assert_equal 8, assigns(:categories).size
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added TagHelper#image_tag and deprecated UrlHelper#link_image_to
(recommended approach is to combine image_tag and link_to instead)

</li>
<li>Fixed textilize to be resilient to getting nil parsed (by using
Object#blank? instead of String#empty?)

</li>
<li>Fixed that the :multipart option in FormTagHelper#form_tag would be ignored
[Yonatan Feldman]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.5.1* (7th March, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed that the routes.rb file wouldn&#8217;t be found on symlinked setups
due to File.expand_path 793 [piotr@t-p-l.com]

</li>
<li>Changed ActiveRecordStore to use Marshal instead of YAML as the latter
proved troublesome in persisting circular dependencies. Updating existing
applications MUST clear their existing session table from data to start
using this updated store 739 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added shortcut :id assignment to render_component and friends (before you
had to go through :params) 784 [Lucas Carlson]

</li>
<li>Fixed that map.connect should convert arguments to strings 780 [Nicholas
Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added UrlHelper#link_to_if/link_to_unless to enable other conditions that
just link_to_unless_current 757 [mindel]

</li>
<li>Fixed that single quote was not escaped in a UrlHelper#link_to javascript
confirm 549 [Scott Barron]

</li>
<li>Removed the default border on link_image_to (it broke xhtml strict) &#8212;
can be specified with :border =&gt; 0 517 [?/caleb]

</li>
<li>Fixed that form helpers would treat string and symbol keys differently in
html_options (and possibly create duplicate entries) 112 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed that broken pipe errors (clients disconnecting in mid-request) could
bring down a fcgi process

</li>
<li>Added the original exception message to session recall errors (so you can
see which class wasnt required)

</li>
<li>Fixed that RAILS_ROOT might not be defined when AP was loaded, so do a late
initialization of the ROUTE_FILE 761 [Scott Barron]

</li>
<li>Fix request.path_info and clear up LoadingModule behavior 754 [Nicholas
Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed caching to be aware of extensions (so you can cache files like
api.wsdl or logo.png) 734 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed that Routes would raise NameErrors if a controller component contains
characters that are not valid constant names 733 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added PATH_INFO access from the request that allows urls like the following
to be interpreted by rails: <a
href="http://www.example.com/dispatcher.cgi/controller/action">www.example.com/dispatcher.cgi/controller/action</a>
&#8212; that makes it possible to use rails as a CGI under lighttpd and
would also allow (for example) Rublog to be ported to rails without
breaking existing links to Rublog-powered blogs. 728 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Fixed that caching the root would result in .html not index.html 731, 734
[alisdair/Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.5.0* (24th February, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Routing as a replacement for mod_rewrite pretty urls [Nicholas
Seckar]. Read more in <a
href="../../../../classes/ActionController/Base.html#M000202">ActionController::Base.url_for</a>
and on <a
href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/9">manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/9</a>

</li>
<li>Added components that allows you to call other actions for their rendered
response while execution another action. You can either delegate the entire
response rendering or you can mix a partial response in with your other
content. Read more on <a
href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/14">manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/14</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
* Fixed that proxy IPs do not follow all RFC1918 nets 251
[caleb@aei-tech.com]
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Base#render_to_string to parse a template and get the result back as
a string 479

</li>
<li>Fixed that send_file/data can work even if render* has been called before
in action processing to render the content of a file to be send for example
601

</li>
<li>Added FormOptionsHelper#time_zone_select and
FormOptionsHelper#time_zone_options_for_select to work with the new value
object <a href="../../../../classes/TimeZone.html">TimeZone</a> in Active
Support 688 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added FormHelper#file_field and FormTagHelper#file_field_tag for creating
file upload fields

</li>
<li>Added :order option for date_select that allows control over the order in
which the date dropdowns is used and which of them should be used 619 [Tim
Bates]. Examples:

<pre>
  date_select(&quot;post&quot;, &quot;written_on&quot;, :order =&gt; [:day, :month, :year])
  date_select(&quot;user&quot;, &quot;birthday&quot;,   :order =&gt; [:month, :day])
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added <a
href="../../../../classes/ActionView/Base.html#M000529">ActionView::Base.register_template_handler</a>
for easy integration of an alternative template language to ERb and
Builder. See test/controller/custom_handler_test.rb for a usage example 656
[Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added AssetTagHelper that provides methods for linking a HTML page together
with other assets, such as javascripts, stylesheets, and feeds.

</li>
<li>Added FormTagHelper that provides a number of methods for creating form
tags that doesn&#8217;t rely on conventions with an object assigned to the
template like FormHelper does. With the FormTagHelper, you provide the
names and values yourself.

</li>
<li>Added Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq to the countries list used by
FormOptions#country_select and FormOptions#country_options_for_select

</li>
<li>Renamed link_to_image to link_image_to (since thats what it actually does)
&#8212; kept alias for the old method name

</li>
<li>Fixed textilize for RedCloth3 to keep doing hardbreaks

</li>
<li>Fixed that assert_template_xpath_matches did not indicate when a path was
not found 658 [Eric Hodel]

</li>
<li>Added TextHelper#auto_link to turn email addresses and urls into ahrefs

</li>
<li>Fixed that on validation errors, scaffold couldn&#8217;t find template 654
[mindel]

</li>
<li>Added Base#hide_action(*names) to hide public methods from a controller
that would otherwise have been callable through the URL. For the majority
of cases, its preferred just to make the methods you don&#8217;t want to
expose protected or private (so they&#8217;ll automatically be hidden)
&#8212; but if you must have a public method, this is a way to make it
uncallable. Base#hidden_actions retrieve the list of all hidden actions for
the controller 644 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed that a bunch of methods from <a
href="../../../../classes/ActionController/Base.html">ActionController::Base</a>
was accessible as actions (callable through a URL) when they
shouldn&#8217;t have been 644 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added UrlHelper#current_page?(options) method to check if the url_for
options passed corresponds to the current page

</li>
<li>Fixed https handling on other ports than 443 [Alan Gano]

</li>
<li>Added follow_redirect method for functional tests that&#8217;ll get-request
the redirect that was made. Example:

<pre>
  def test_create_post
    post :create, &quot;post&quot; =&gt; { &quot;title&quot; =&gt; &quot;Exciting!&quot; }
    assert_redirected_to :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;

    follow_redirect
    assert_rendered_file &quot;post/show&quot;
  end
</pre>
<p>
Limitation: Only works for redirects to other actions within the same
controller.
</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed double requiring of models with the same name as the controller

</li>
<li>Fixed that query params could be forced to nil on a POST due to the raw
post fix 562 [moriq@moriq.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed that cookies shouldn&#8217;t be frozen in TestRequest 571 [Eric
Hodel]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.4.0* (January 25th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed problems with ActiveRecordStore under the development environment in
Rails

</li>
<li>Fixed the ordering of attributes in the xml-decleration of Builder 540
[woeye]

</li>
<li>Added @request.raw_post as a convenience access to
@request.env[&#8216;RAW_POST_DATA&#8217;] 534 [Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Added support for automatic id-based indexing for lists of items 532
[dblack]. Example:

<pre>
  &lt;% @students.each do |@student| %&gt;
    &lt;%= text_field &quot;student[]&quot;, &quot;first_name&quot;, :size =&gt; &quot;20&quot; %&gt;
    &lt;%= text_field &quot;student[]&quot;, &quot;last_name&quot; %&gt;
    &lt;%= text_field &quot;student[]&quot;, &quot;grade&quot;, :size =&gt; &quot;5&quot; %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;would produce, for say David Black with id 123 and a grace of C+:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;input id=&quot;student_123_first_name&quot; name=&quot;student[123][first_name]&quot; size=&quot;20&quot;     size=&quot;30&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;David&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input id=&quot;student_123_last_name&quot; name=&quot;student[123][last_name]&quot; size=&quot;30&quot;  type=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;Black&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input id=&quot;student_123_grade&quot; name=&quot;student[123][grade]&quot; size=&quot;5&quot; type=&quot;text&quot;  value=&quot;C+&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added :application_prefix to url_for and friends that makes it easier to
setup Rails in non-vhost environments 516 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added :encode option to mail_to that&#8217;ll allow you to masquarede the
email address behind javascript or hex encoding 494 [Lucas Carlson]

</li>
<li>Fixed that the content-header was being set to application/octet_stream
instead of application/octet-stream on send_date/file [Alexey]

</li>
<li>Removed the need for passing the binding when using CacheHelper#cache

</li>
<li>Added TestResponse#binary_content that&#8217;ll return as a string the data
sent through send_data/send_file for testing 500 [Alexey]

</li>
<li>Added @request.env[&#8216;RAW_POST_DATA&#8217;] for people who need access
to the data before Ruby&#8217;s CGI has parsed it 505 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed that a default fragment store wan&#8217;t being set to MemoryStore as
intended.

</li>
<li>Fixed that all redirect and render calls now return true, so you can use
the pattern of &quot;do and return&quot;. Example:

<pre>
  def show
    redirect_to(:action =&gt; &quot;login&quot;) and return unless @person.authenticated?
    render_text &quot;I won't happen unless the person is authenticated&quot;
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added that renders and redirects called in before_filters will have the
same effect as returning false: stopping the chain. Example:

<pre>
  class WeblogController
    before_filter { |c| c.send(:redirect_to_url(&quot;http://www.farfaraway.com&quot;)}) }

    def hello
      render_text &quot;I will never be called&quot;
    end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added that only one render or redirect can happen per action. The first
call wins and subsequent calls are ignored. Example:

<pre>
  def do_something
    redirect_to :action =&gt; &quot;elsewhere&quot;
    render_action &quot;overthere&quot;
  end
</pre>
<p>
Only the redirect happens. The rendering call is simply ignored.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.3.1* (January 18th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where cookies wouldn&#8217;t be set if a symbol was used
instead of a string as the key

</li>
<li>Added assert_cookie_equal to assert the contents of a named cookie

</li>
<li>Fixed bug in page caching that prevented it from working at all

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.3.0* (January 17th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added an extensive caching module that offers three levels of granularity
(page, action, fragment) and a variety of stores. Read more in <a
href="../../../../classes/ActionController/Caching.html">ActionController::Caching</a>.

</li>
<li>Added the option of passing a block to ActiveRecordHelper#form in order to
add more to the auto-generated form 469 [dom@sisna.com]

<pre>
  form(&quot;entry&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;sign&quot;) do |form|
    form &lt;&lt; content_tag(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;Department&quot;)
    form &lt;&lt; collection_select(&quot;department&quot;, &quot;id&quot;, @departments, &quot;id&quot;, &quot;name&quot;)
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added arrays as a value option for params in url_for and friends 467 [Eric
Anderson]. Example:

<pre>
  url_for(:controller =&gt; 'user', :action =&gt; 'delete', :params =&gt; { 'username' =&gt;  %( paul john steve ) } )
  # =&gt; /user/delete?username[]=paul&amp;username[]=john&amp;username[]=steve
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that controller tests can now assert on the use of cookies 466
[Alexey]

</li>
<li>Fixed that send_file would &quot;remember&quot; all the files sent by
adding to the headers again and again 458 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed url rewriter confusion when the controller or action name was a
substring of the controller_prefix or action_prefix

</li>
<li>Added conditional layouts like <tt>layout &quot;weblog_standard&quot;,
:except =&gt; :rss</tt> 452 [Marcel Molina]

</li>
<li>Fixed that MemCacheStore wasn&#8217;t included by default and added default
MemCache object pointing to localhost 447 [Lucas Carlson]

</li>
<li>Added fourth argument to render_collection_of_partials that allows you to
specify local_assigns &#8212; just like render_partial 432 [zenspider]

</li>
<li>Fixed that host would choke when cgi.host returned nil 432 [Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Added that form helpers now take an index option 448 [Tim Bates]

<p>
Example:
</p>
<pre>
  text_field &quot;person&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;index&quot; =&gt; 3
</pre>
<p>
Becomes:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;person[3][name]&quot; id=&quot;person_3_name&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%= @person.name %&gt;&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed three issues with retrying breakpoints 417 [Florian Gross]

<ol>
<li>Don&#8216;t screw up pages that use multiple values for the same parameter
(?foo=bar&amp;foo=qux was converted to ?foo=barqux)

</li>
<li>Don&#8216;t screw up all forms when you click the &quot;Retry with <a
href="../../../../classes/Breakpoint.html">Breakpoint</a>&quot; link
multiple times instead of reloading (This caused the parameters to be added
multiple times for GET forms leading to trouble.)

</li>
<li>Don&#8216;t add ?BP-RETRY=1 multiple times

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Added that all renders and redirects now return false, so they can be used
as the last line in before_filters to stop execution.

<p>
Before:
</p>
<pre>
  def authenticate
    unless @session[:authenticated]
      redirect_to :controller =&gt; &quot;account&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;login&quot;
      return false
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
After:
</p>
<pre>
  def authenticate
    redirect_to(:controller =&gt; &quot;account&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;login&quot;) unless @session[:authenticated]
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added conditional filters 431 [Marcel]. Example:

<pre>
  class JournalController &lt; ActionController::Base
    # only require authentication if the current action is edit or delete
    before_filter :authorize, :only_on =&gt; [ :edit, :delete ]

    private
      def authorize
        # redirect to login unless authenticated
      end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base#render_nothing as a cleaner way of doing render_text
&quot;&quot; when you&#8217;re not interested in returning anything but an
empty response.

</li>
<li>Added the possibility of passing nil to UrlHelper#link_to to use the link
itself as the name

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.2.0* (January 4th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added MemCacheStore for storing session data in Danga&#8217;s MemCache
system [Bob Cottrell] Depends on: MemCached server (<a
href="http://www.danga.com/memcached">www.danga.com/memcached</a>/),
MemCache client (<a
href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/memcache">raa.ruby-lang.org/project/memcache</a>/)

</li>
<li>Added thread-safety to the DRbStore 66, 389 [Ben Stiglitz]

</li>
<li>Added DateHelper#select_time and DateHelper#select_second 373 [Scott Baron]

</li>
<li>Added :host and :protocol options to url_for and friends to redirect to
another host and protocol than the current.

</li>
<li>Added class declaration for the MissingFile exception 388 [Kent Sibilev]

</li>
<li>Added &quot;short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s)&quot;
to redirects to fulfill compliance with RFC 2616 (HTTP/1.1) section 10.3.3
397 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Added second boolean parameter to Base.redirect_to_url and
Response#redirect to control whether the redirect is permanent or not (301
vs 302) 375 [Hodel]

</li>
<li>Fixed redirects when the controller and action is named the same. Still
haven&#8217;t fixed same controller, module, and action, though 201 [Josh]

</li>
<li>Fixed problems with running multiple functional tests in Rails under 1.8.2
by including hack for test/unit weirdness

</li>
<li>Fixed that @request.remote_ip didn&#8217;t work in the test environment 369
[Bruno Mattarollo]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.1.0*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added search through session to clear out association caches at the end of
each request. This makes it possible to place Active Record objects in the
session without worrying about stale data in the associations (the main
object is still subject to caching, naturally) 347 [Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Added more informative exception when using helper :some_helper and the
helper requires another file that fails, you&#8217;ll get an error message
tells you what file actually failed to load, rather than falling back on
assuming it was the helper file itself 346 [dblack]

</li>
<li>Added use of *_before_type_cast for all input and text fields. This is
helpful for getting &quot;100,000&quot; back on a integer-based validation
where the value would normally be &quot;100&quot;.

</li>
<li>Added Request#port_string to get something like &quot;:8080&quot; back on
8080 and &quot;&quot; on 80 (or 443 with https).

</li>
<li>Added Request#domain (returns string) and Request#subdomains (returns
array).

</li>
<li>Added POST support for the breakpoint retries, so form processing that
raises an exception can be retried with the original request [Florian
Gross]

</li>
<li>Fixed regression with Base#reset_session that wouldn&#8217;t use the
DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS [adam@the-kramers.net]

</li>
<li>Fixed error rendering of rxml documents to not just swallow the exception
and return 0 (still not guessing the right line, but hey)

</li>
<li>Fixed that textilize and markdown would instantiate their engines even on
empty strings. This also fixes 333 [Ulysses]

</li>
<li>Fixed UrlHelper#link_to_unless so it doesn&#8217;t care if the id is a
string or fixnum [zenspider]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.0.1*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause an ApplicationController to require itself
three times and hence cause filters to be run three times [evl]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.0*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added that controllers will now attempt to require a model dependency with
their name and in a singular attempt for their name. So both PostController
and PostsController will automatically have the post.rb model required. If
no model is found, no error is raised, as it is then expected that no match
is available and the programmer will have included his own models.

</li>
<li>Fixed DateHelper#date_select so that you can pass include_blank as an
option even if you don&#8217;t use start_year and end_year 59 [what-a-day]

</li>
<li>Added that controllers will now search for a layout in
$template_root/layouts/$controller_name.r(html|xml), so PostsController
will look for layouts/posts.rhtml or layouts/posts.rxml and automatically
configure this layout if found 307 [Marcel]

</li>
<li>Added FormHelper#radio_button to work with radio buttons like its already
possible with check boxes [Michael Koziarski]

</li>
<li>Added TemplateError#backtrace that makes it much easier to debug template
errors from unit and functional tests

</li>
<li>Added display of error messages with scaffolded form pages

</li>
<li>Added option to ERB templates to swallow newlines by using &lt;% if
something -%&gt; instead of just &lt;% if something %&gt;. Example:

<pre>
  class SomeController &lt; ApplicationController
  &lt;% if options[:scaffold] %&gt;
    scaffold :&lt;%= singular_name %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
    helper :post
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;produces this on post as singular_name:
</p>
<pre>
  class SomeController &lt; ApplicationController

    scaffold :post

    helper :post
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;where as:
</p>
<pre>
  class SomeController &lt; ApplicationController
  &lt;% if options[:scaffold] -%&gt;
    scaffold :&lt;%= singular_name %&gt;
  &lt;% end -%&gt;
    helper :post
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;produces:
</p>
<pre>
  class SomeController &lt; ApplicationController
    scaffold :post
    helper :post
</pre>
<p>
[This undocumented gem for ERb was uncovered by bitsweat]
</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed CgiRequest so that it&#8217;ll now accept session options with
Symbols as keys (as the documentation points out) [Suggested by Andreas]

</li>
<li>Added that render_partial will always by default include a counter with
value 1 unless there is a counter passed in via the local_assigns hash that
overrides it. As a result, render_collection_of_partials can still be
written in terms of render_partial and partials that make use of a counter
can be called without problems from both render_collection_of_partials as
well as render_partial 295 [marcel]

</li>
<li>Fixed CgiRequest#out to fall back to write if $stdout doesn&#8217;t have
syswrite [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed all helpers so that they use XHTML compliant double quotes for values
instead of single quotes [htonl/bitsweat]

</li>
<li>Added link_to_image(src, options = {}, html_options = {},
*parameters_for_method_reference). Documentation:

<pre>
  Creates a link tag to the image residing at the +src+ using an URL created by the set of +options+. See the valid options in
  link:classes/ActionController/Base.html#M000021. It's also possible to pass a string instead of an options hash to
  get a link tag that just points without consideration. The &lt;tt&gt;html_options&lt;/tt&gt; works jointly for the image and ahref tag by
  letting the following special values enter the options on the image and the rest goes to the ahref:

  ::alt: If no alt text is given, the file name part of the +src+ is used (capitalized and without the extension)
  ::size: Supplied as &quot;XxY&quot;, so &quot;30x45&quot; becomes width=&quot;30&quot; and height=&quot;45&quot;
  ::align: Sets the alignment, no special features

  The +src+ can be supplied as a...
  * full path, like &quot;/my_images/image.gif&quot;
  * file name, like &quot;rss.gif&quot;, that gets expanded to &quot;/images/rss.gif&quot;
  * file name without extension, like &quot;logo&quot;, that gets expanded to &quot;/images/logo.png&quot;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed to_input_field_tag so it no longer explicitly uses InstanceTag.value
if value was specified in the options hash [evl]

</li>
<li>Added the possibility of having validate be protected for
assert_(in)valid_column 263 [Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Added that ActiveRecordHelper#form now calls url_for on the :action option.

</li>
<li>Added all the HTTP methods as alternatives to the generic
&quot;process&quot; for functional testing 276 [Tobias Luetke]. Examples:

<pre>
  # Calls Controller#miletone with a GET request
  process :milestone

  # Calls Controller#miletone with a POST request that has parameters
  post :milestone, { &quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;David&quot; }

  # Calls Controller#milestone with a HEAD request that has both parameters and session data
  head :milestone, { &quot;id&quot; =&gt; 1 }, { &quot;user_id&quot; =&gt; 23 }
</pre>
<p>
This is especially useful for testing idiomatic REST web services.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added proper handling of HEAD requests, so that content isn&#8217;t
returned (Request#head? added as well) 277 [Eric Hodel]

</li>
<li>Added indifference to whether @headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;],
@headers[&quot;Content-type&quot;], or @headers[&quot;content-type&quot;]
is used.

</li>
<li>Added TestSession#session_id that returns an empty string to make it easier
to functional test applications that doesn&#8217;t use cookie-based
sessions 275 [jcf]

</li>
<li>Fixed that cached template loading would still check the file system to see
if the file existed 258 [Andreas Schwarz]

</li>
<li>Added options to tailor header tag, div id, and div class on
ActiveRecordHelper#error_messages_for [josh]

</li>
<li>Added graceful handling of non-alphanumeric names and misplaced brackets in
input parameters [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added a new container for cookies that makes them more intuative to use.
The old methods of cookie and @cookies have been deprecated.

<p>
Examples for writing:
</p>
<pre>
  cookies[&quot;user_name&quot;] = &quot;david&quot; # =&gt; Will set a simple session cookie
  cookies[&quot;login&quot;] = { &quot;value&quot; =&gt; &quot;XJ-122&quot;, &quot;expires&quot; =&gt; Time.now + 360} # =&gt; Will set a cookie that expires in 1 hour
</pre>
<p>
Examples for reading:
</p>
<pre>
  cookies[&quot;user_name&quot;] # =&gt; &quot;david&quot;
  cookies.size         # =&gt; 2
</pre>
<p>
Read more in <a
href="../../../../classes/ActionController/Cookies.html">ActionController::Cookies</a>
</p>
<p>
NOTE: If you were using the old accessor (cookies instead of @cookies),
this could potentially break your code &#8212; if you expect a full cookie
object!
</p>
</li>
<li>Added the opportunity to defined method_missing on a controller which will
handle all requests for actions not otherwise defined 223 [timb]

</li>
<li>Fixed AbstractRequest#remote_ip for users going through proxies - Patch 228
[Eric Hodel]

</li>
<li>Added Request#ssl? which is shorthand for @request.protocol ==
&quot;https://&quot;

</li>
<li>Added the choice to call form_tag with no arguments (resulting in a form
posting to current action) [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Upgraded to Builder 1.2.1

</li>
<li>Added :module as an alias for :controller_prefix to url_for and friends, so
you can do redirect_to(:module =&gt; &quot;shop&quot;, :controller =&gt;
&quot;purchases&quot;) and go to /shop/purchases/

</li>
<li>Added support for controllers in modules through
@params[&quot;module&quot;].

</li>
<li>Added reloading for dependencies under cached environments like FastCGI and
mod_ruby. This makes it possible to use those environments for development.
This is turned on by default, but can be turned off with
ActionController::Base.reload_dependencies = false in production
environments.

<p>
NOTE: This will only have an effect if you use the new model, service, and
observer class methods to mark dependencies. All libraries loaded through
require will be &quot;forever&quot; cached. You can, however, use
ActionController::Base.load_or_require(&quot;library&quot;) to get this
behavior outside of the new dependency style.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added that controllers will automatically require their own helper if
possible. So instead of doing:

<pre>
  class MsgController &lt; ApplicationController
    helper :msg
  end
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;you can just do:
</p>
<pre>
  class MsgController &lt; ApplicationController
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added dependencies_on(layer) to query the dependencies of a controller.
Examples:

<pre>
  MsgController.dependencies_on(:model)    # =&gt; [ :post, :comment, :attachment ]
  MsgController.dependencies_on(:service)  # =&gt; [ :notification_service ]
  MsgController.dependencies_on(:observer) # =&gt; [ :comment_observer ]
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added a new dependency model with the class methods model, service, and
observer. Example:

<pre>
  class MsgController &lt; ApplicationController
    model    :post, :comment, :attachment
    service  :notification_service
    observer :comment_observer
  end
</pre>
<p>
These new &quot;keywords&quot; remove the need for explicitly calling
&#8216;require&#8217; in most cases. The observer method even instantiates
the observer as well as requiring it.
</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed that link_to would escape &amp; in the url again after url_for
already had done so

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.9.5* (28)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added helper_method to designate that a given private or protected method
you should available as a helper in the view. [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed assert_rendered_file so it actually verifies if that was the rendered
file [htonl]

</li>
<li>Added the option for sharing partial spacer templates just like partials
themselves [radsaq]

</li>
<li>Fixed that Russia was named twice in country_select [alexey]

</li>
<li>Fixed request_origin to use remote_ip instead of remote_addr [Jeremy
Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed link_to breakage when nil was passed for html_options [alexey]

</li>
<li>Fixed redirect_to on a virtual server setup with apache with a port other
than the default where it would forget the port number [seanohalpin]

</li>
<li>Fixed that auto-loading webrick on Windows would cause file uploads to fail
[Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed issues with sending files on WEBrick by setting the proper binmode
[Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added send_data as an alternative to send_file when the stream is not read
off the filesystem but from a database or generated live [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added a new way to include helpers that doesn&#8217;t require the include
hack and can go without the explicit require. [Jeremy Kemper]

<p>
Before:
</p>
<pre>
  module WeblogHelper
    def self.append_features(controller) #:nodoc:
      controller.ancestors.include?(ActionController::Base) ? controller.add_template_helper(self) : super
    end
  end

  require 'weblog_helper'
  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    include WeblogHelper
  end
</pre>
<p>
After:
</p>
<pre>
  module WeblogHelper
  end

  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    helper :weblog
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added a default content-type of &quot;text/xml&quot; to .rxml renders [Ryan
Platte]

</li>
<li>Fixed that when /controller/index was requested by the browser, url_for
would generates wrong URLs [Ryan Platte]

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would share cookies between users when using FastCGI and
mod_ruby [The Robot Co-op]

</li>
<li>Added an optional third hash parameter to the process method in functional
tests that takes the session data to be used [alexey]

</li>
<li>Added UrlHelper#mail_to to make it easier to create mailto: style ahrefs

</li>
<li>Added better error messages for layouts declared with the .rhtml extension
(which they shouldn&#8217;t) [geech]

</li>
<li>Added another case to DateHelper#distance_in_minutes to return &quot;less
than a minute&quot; instead of &quot;0 minutes&quot; and &quot;1
minute&quot; instead of &quot;1 minutes&quot;

</li>
<li>Added a hidden field to checkboxes generated with FormHelper#check_box that
will make sure that the unchecked value (usually 0) is sent even if the
checkbox is not checked. This relieves the controller from doing custom
checking if the checkbox wasn&#8217;t checked. BEWARE: This might conflict
with your run-on-the-mill work-around code. [Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Fixed error_message_on to just use the first if more than one error had
been added [marcel]

</li>
<li>Fixed that URL rewriting with /controller/ was working but /controller was
not and that you couldn&#8217;t use :id on index [geech]

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with link_to where the :confirm option wouldn&#8217;t be picked
up if the link was a straight url instead of an option hash

</li>
<li>Changed scaffolding of forms to use &lt;label&gt; tags instead of &lt;b&gt;
to please W3C [evl]

</li>
<li>Added DateHelper#distance_of_time_in_words_to_now(from_time) that works
like distance_of_time_in_words, but where <tt>to_time</tt> is fixed to
<tt>Time.now</tt>.

</li>
<li>Added assert_flash_equal(expected, key, message),
assert_session_equal(expected, key, message),
assert_assigned_equal(expected, key, message) to test the contents of
flash, session, and template assigns.

</li>
<li>Improved the failure report on assert_success when the action triggered a
redirection [alexey].

</li>
<li>Added &quot;markdown&quot; to accompany &quot;textilize&quot; as a
TextHelper method for converting text to HTML using the Markdown syntax.
BlueCloth must be installed in order for this method to become available.

</li>
<li>Made sure that an active session exists before we attempt to delete it
[Samuel]

</li>
<li>Changed link_to with Javascript confirmation to use onclick instead of
onClick for XHTML validity [Scott Barron]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.9.0 (43)*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Builder-based templates for files with the .rxml
extension. These new templates are an alternative to ERb that are
especially useful for generating XML content, such as this RSS example from
Basecamp:

<pre>
  xml.rss(&quot;version&quot; =&gt; &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;xmlns:dc&quot; =&gt; &quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;) do
    xml.channel do
      xml.title(@feed_title)
      xml.link(@url)
      xml.description &quot;Basecamp: Recent items&quot;
      xml.language &quot;en-us&quot;
      xml.ttl &quot;40&quot;

      for item in @recent_items
        xml.item do
          xml.title(item_title(item))
          xml.description(item_description(item)) if item_description(item)
          xml.pubDate(item_pubDate(item))
          xml.guid(@person.firm.account.url + @recent_items.url(item))
          xml.link(@person.firm.account.url + @recent_items.url(item))

          xml.tag!(&quot;dc:creator&quot;, item.author_name) if item_has_creator?(item)
        end
      end
    end
  end

  ...which will generate something like:

  &lt;rss version=&quot;2.0&quot; xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;&gt;
    &lt;channel&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Web Site Redesign&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;link&gt;http://www.basecamphq.com/clients/travelcenter/1/&lt;/link&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;Basecamp: Recent items&lt;/description&gt;
      &lt;language&gt;en-us&lt;/language&gt;
      &lt;ttl&gt;40&lt;/ttl&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Post: don't you know&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;deeper and down&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/description&gt;

    &lt;/channel&gt;
  &lt;/rss&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The &quot;xml&quot; local variable is automatically available in .rxml
templates. You construct the template by calling a method with the name of
the tag you want. Options for the tag can be specified as a hash parameter
to that method.
</p>
<p>
Builder-based templates can be mixed and matched with the regular ERb ones.
The only thing that differentiates them is the extension. No new methods
have been added to the public interface to handle them.
</p>
<p>
Action Pack ships with a version of Builder, but it will use the RubyGems
version if you have one installed.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
[Builder is created by Jim Weirich]
</p>
</li>
<li>Added much improved support for functional testing [what-a-day].

<pre>
  # Old style
  def test_failing_authenticate
    @request.request_uri = &quot;/login/authenticate&quot;
    @request.action = &quot;authenticate&quot;
    @request.request_parameters[&quot;user_name&quot;] = &quot;nop&quot;
    @request.request_parameters[&quot;password&quot;]  = &quot;&quot;

    response = LoginController.process_test(@request)

    assert_equal &quot;The username and/or password you entered is invalid.&quot;, response.session[&quot;flash&quot;][&quot;alert&quot;]
    assert_equal &quot;http://37signals.basecamp.com/login/&quot;, response.headers[&quot;location&quot;]
  end

  # New style
  def test_failing_authenticate
    process :authenticate, &quot;user_name&quot; =&gt; &quot;nop&quot;, &quot;password&quot; =&gt; &quot;&quot;
    assert_flash_has 'alert'
    assert_redirected_to :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot;
  end
</pre>

</p>
</li>
<li>Increased performance by up to 100% with a revised cookie class that fixes
the performance problems with the default one that ships with 1.8.1 and
below. It replaces the inheritance on SimpleDelegator with
DelegateClass(Array) following the suggestion from Matz on: <a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?th=e3a4e68ba042f842&seekm=c3sioe%241qvm%241%40news.cybercity.dk#link14">groups.google.com/groups?th=e3a4e68ba042f842&seekm=c3sioe%241qvm%241%40news.cybercity.dk#link14</a>

</li>
<li>Added caching for compiled ERb templates. On Basecamp, it gave between 8.5%
and 71% increase in performance [Andreas Schwarz].

</li>
<li>Added implicit counter variable to render_collection_of_partials [Marcel].
From the docs:

<pre>
  &lt;%= render_collection_of_partials &quot;ad&quot;, @advertisements %&gt;

  This will render &quot;advertiser/_ad.rhtml&quot; and pass the local variable +ad+ to the template for display. An iteration counter
  will automatically be made available to the template with a name of the form +partial_name_counter+. In the case of the
  example above, the template would be fed +ad_counter+.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed problems with two sessions being maintained on reset_session that
would particularly screw up ActiveRecordStore.

</li>
<li>Fixed reset_session to start an entirely new session instead of merely
deleting the old. So you can now safely access @session after calling
reset_ression and expect it to work.

</li>
<li>Added @request.get?, @request.post?, @request.put?, @request.delete? as
convenience query methods for @request.method [geech]

</li>
<li>Added @request.method that&#8217;ll return a symbol representing the HTTP
method, such as :get, :post, :put, :delete [geech]

</li>
<li>Changed @request.remote_ip and @request.host to work properly even when a
proxy is in front of the application [geech]

</li>
<li>Added JavaScript confirm feature to link_to. Documentation:

<pre>
  The html_options have a special feature for creating javascript confirm alerts where if you pass
  :confirm =&gt; 'Are you sure?', the link will be guarded with a JS popup asking that question.
  If the user accepts, the link is processed, otherwise not.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added link_to_unless_current as a UrlHelper method [Sam Stephenson].
Documentation:

<pre>
  Creates a link tag of the given +name+ using an URL created by the set of +options+, unless the current
  controller, action, and id are the same as the link's, in which case only the name is returned (or the
  given block is yielded, if one exists). This is useful for creating link bars where you don't want to link
  to the page currently being viewed.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that UrlRewriter (the driver for url_for, link_to, etc) would blow up
when the anchor was an integer [alexey]

</li>
<li>Added that layouts defined with no directory defaults to layouts. So layout
&quot;weblog/standard&quot; will use weblog/standard (as always), but
layout &quot;standard&quot; will use layouts/standard.

</li>
<li>Fixed that partials (or any template starting with an underscore) was
publically viewable [Marten]

</li>
<li>Added HTML escaping to text_area helper.

</li>
<li>Added :overwrite_params to url_for and friends to keep the parameters as
they were passed to the current action and only overwrite a subset. The
regular :params will clear the slate so you need to manually add in
existing parameters if you want to reuse them. [raphinou]

</li>
<li>Fixed scaffolding problem with composite named objects [Moo Jester]

</li>
<li>Added the possibility for shared partials. Example:

<pre>
  &lt;%= render_partial &quot;advertisement/ad&quot;, ad %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This will render the partial &quot;advertisement/_ad.rhtml&quot; regardless
of which controller this is being called from.
</p>
<p>
[Jacob Fugal]
</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed crash when encountering forms that have empty-named fields [James
Prudente]

</li>
<li>Added check_box form helper method now accepts true/false as well as 1/0
[what-a-day]

</li>
<li>Fixed the lacking creation of all directories with install.rb [Dave
Steinberg]

</li>
<li>Fixed that date_select returns valid XHTML selected options [Andreas
Schwarz]

</li>
<li>Fixed referencing an action with the same name as a controller in url_for
[what-a-day]

</li>
<li>Fixed the destructive nature of Base#attributes= on the argument [Kevin
Watt]

</li>
<li>Changed ActionControllerError to decent from StandardError instead of
Exception. It can now be caught by a generic rescue.

</li>
<li>Added SessionRestoreError that is raised when a session being restored
holds objects where there is no class available.

</li>
<li>Added block as option for inline filters. So what used to be written as:

<pre>
  before_filter Proc { |controller| return false if controller.params[&quot;stop_action&quot;] }
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;can now be as:
</p>
<pre>
  before_filter { |controller| return false if controller.params[&quot;stop_action&quot;] }
</pre>
<p>
[Jeremy Kemper]
</p>
</li>
<li>Made the following methods public (was protected): url_for,
controller_class_name, controller_name, action_name This makes it easier to
write filters without cheating around the encapsulation with send.

</li>
<li><a
href="../../../../classes/ActionController/Base.html#M000212">ActionController::Base#reset_session</a>
now sticks even if you access @session afterwards [Kent Sibilev]

</li>
<li>Improved the exception logging so the log file gets almost as much as
in-browser debugging.

</li>
<li>Changed base class setup from AbstractTemplate/ERbTemplate to <a
href="../../../../classes/ActionView/Base.html">ActionView::Base</a>. This
change should be harmless unless you were accessing Action View directly in
which case you now need to reference the Base class.\

</li>
<li>Added that render_collection_of_partials returns nil if the collection is
empty. This makes showing a “no items” message easier. For example:
&lt;%= render_collection_of_partials(&quot;message&quot;, @messages) ||
&quot;No messages found.&quot; %&gt; [Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Added :month_before_year as an option to date_select to get the month
select before the year. Especially useful for credit card forms.

</li>
<li>Added :add_month_numbers to select_month to get options like &quot;3 -
March&quot;.

</li>
<li>Removed Base.has_active_layout? as it couldn&#8217;t answer the question
without the instance. Use Base#active_layout instead.

</li>
<li>Removed redundant call to update on ActionController::Base#close_session
[Andreas Schwarz]

</li>
<li>Fixed that DRb Store accidently started its own server (instead of just
client) [Andreas]

</li>
<li>Fixed strip_links so it now works across multiple lines [Chad Fowler]

</li>
<li>Fixed the TemplateError exception to show the proper trace on to_s (useful
for unit test debugging)

</li>
<li>Implemented class inheritable attributes without eval [Caio Chassot]

</li>
<li>Made TextHelper#concat accept binding as it would otherwise not work

</li>
<li>The FormOptionsHelper will now call to_s on the keys and values used to
generate options

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.8.5*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced passing of locally scoped variables between templates:

<pre>
  You can pass local variables to sub templates by using a hash of with the variable
  names as keys and the objects as values:

    &lt;%= render &quot;shared/header&quot;, { &quot;headline&quot; =&gt; &quot;Welcome&quot;, &quot;person&quot; =&gt; person } %&gt;

  These can now be accessed in shared/header with:

    Headline: &lt;%= headline %&gt;
    First name: &lt;%= person.first_name %&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Introduced the concept of partials as a certain type of sub templates:

<pre>
  There's also a convenience method for rendering sub templates within the current
  controller that depends on a single object (we call this kind of sub templates for
  partials). It relies on the fact that partials should follow the naming convention
  of being prefixed with an underscore -- as to separate them from regular templates
  that could be rendered on their own. In the template for Advertiser#buy, we could have:

    &lt;% for ad in @advertisements %&gt;
      &lt;%= render_partial &quot;ad&quot;, ad %&gt;
    &lt;% end %&gt;

  This would render &quot;advertiser/_ad.rhtml&quot; and pass the local variable +ad+
  for the template to display.

  == Rendering a collection of partials

  The example of partial use describes a familar pattern where a template needs
  to iterate over a array and render a sub template for each of the elements.
  This pattern has been implemented as a single method that accepts an array and
  renders a partial by the same name of as the elements contained within. So the
  three-lined example in &quot;Using partials&quot; can be rewritten with a single line:

    &lt;%= render_collection_of_partials &quot;ad&quot;, @advertisements %&gt;

  So this will render &quot;advertiser/_ad.rhtml&quot; and pass the local variable +ad+ for
  the template to display.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Improved send_file by allowing a wide range of options to be applied
[Jeremy Kemper]:

<pre>
  Sends the file by streaming it 4096 bytes at a time. This way the
  whole file doesn't need to be read into memory at once.  This makes
  it feasible to send even large files.

  Be careful to sanitize the path parameter if it coming from a web
  page.  send_file(@params['path'] allows a malicious user to
  download any file on your server.

  Options:
  * &lt;tt&gt;:filename&lt;/tt&gt; - specifies the filename the browser will see.
    Defaults to File.basename(path).
  * &lt;tt&gt;:type&lt;/tt&gt; - specifies an HTTP content type.
    Defaults to 'application/octet-stream'.
  * &lt;tt&gt;:disposition&lt;/tt&gt; - specifies whether the file will be shown inline or downloaded.
    Valid values are 'inline' and 'attachment' (default).
  * &lt;tt&gt;:buffer_size&lt;/tt&gt; - specifies size (in bytes) of the buffer used to stream
    the file.  Defaults to 4096.

  The default Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers are
  set to download arbitrary binary files in as many browsers as
  possible.  IE versions 4, 5, 5.5, and 6 are all known to have
  a variety of quirks (especially when downloading over SSL).

  Simple download:
    send_file '/path/to.zip'

  Show a JPEG in browser:
    send_file '/path/to.jpeg', :type =&gt; 'image/jpeg', :disposition =&gt; 'inline'

  Read about the other Content-* HTTP headers if you'd like to
  provide the user with more information (such as Content-Description).
  http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.11

  Also be aware that the document may be cached by proxies and browsers.
  The Pragma and Cache-Control headers declare how the file may be cached
  by intermediaries.  They default to require clients to validate with
  the server before releasing cached responses.  See
  http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/ for an overview of web caching and
  http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9
  for the Cache-Control header spec.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added pluralize method to the TextHelper that makes it easy to get strings
like &quot;1 message&quot;, &quot;3 messages&quot;

</li>
<li>Added proper escaping for the rescues [Andreas Schwartz]

</li>
<li>Added proper escaping for the option and collection tags [Andreas Schwartz]

</li>
<li>Fixed NaN errors on benchmarking [Jim Weirich]

</li>
<li>Fixed query string parsing for URLs that use the escaped versions of &amp;
or ; as part of a key or value

</li>
<li>Fixed bug with custom Content-Type headers being in addition to rather than
instead of the default header. (This bug didn&#8217;t matter with neither
CGI or mod_ruby, but FCGI exploded on it) [With help from Ara T. Howard]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.8.0*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added select, collection_select, and country_select to make it easier for
Active Records to set attributes through drop-down lists of options.
Example:

<pre>
  &lt;%= select &quot;person&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, %w( Male Female ) %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;would give the following:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;select name=&quot;person[gender]&quot; id=&quot;person_gender&quot;&gt;&lt;option&gt;Male&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option&gt;Female&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added an option for getting multiple values on a single form name into an
array instead of having the last one overwrite. This is especially useful
for groups of checkboxes, which can now be written as:

<pre>
  &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;rights[]&quot; value=&quot;CREATE&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;rights[]&quot; value=&quot;UPDATE&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;rights[]&quot; value=&quot;DELETE&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;and retrieved in the controller action with:
</p>
<pre>
  @params[&quot;rights&quot;] # =&gt; [ &quot;CREATE&quot;, &quot;UPDATE&quot;, &quot;DELETE&quot; ]
</pre>
<p>
The old behavior (where the last one wins, &quot;DELETE&quot; in the
example) is still available. Just don&#8217;t add &quot;[]&quot; to the end
of the name. [Scott Baron]
</p>
</li>
<li>Added send_file which uses the new render_text block acceptance to make it
feasible to send large files. The files is sent with a bunch of voodoo HTTP
headers required to get arbitrary files to download as expected in as many
browsers as possible (eg, IE hacks). Example:

<p>
def play_movie
</p>
<pre>
  send_file &quot;/movies/that_movie.avi&quot;
</pre>
<p>
end
</p>
<p>
[Jeremy Kemper]
</p>
</li>
<li>render_text now accepts a block for deferred rendering. Useful for
streaming large files, displaying a “please wait” message during a
complex search, etc. Streaming example:

<pre>
  render_text do |response|
    File.open(path, 'rb') do |file|
      while buf = file.read(1024)
        print buf
      end
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
[Jeremy Kemper]
</p>
</li>
<li>Added a new Tag Helper that can generate generic tags programmatically
insted of through HTML. Example:

<pre>
  tag(&quot;br&quot;, &quot;clear&quot; =&gt; &quot;all&quot;) =&gt; &lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;that&#8217;s usually not terribly interesting (unless you have a lot
of options already in a hash), but it gives way for more specific tags,
like the new form tag:
</p>
<pre>
  form_tag({ :controller =&gt; &quot;weblog&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;update&quot; }, { :multipart =&gt; &quot;true&quot;, &quot;style&quot; =&gt; &quot;width: 200px&quot;}) =&gt;
    &lt;form action=&quot;/weblog/update&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/formdata&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px&quot;&gt;
</pre>
<p>
There&#8217;s even a &quot;pretty&quot; version for people who don&#8217;t
like to open tags in code and close them in HTML:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;%= start_form_tag :action =&gt; &quot;update&quot; %&gt;
    # all the input fields
  &lt;%= end_form_tag %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
(end_form_tag just returns &quot;&lt;/form&gt;&quot;)
</p>
</li>
<li>The selected parameter in options_for_select may now also an array of
values to be selected when using a multiple select. Example:

<pre>
  options_for_select([ &quot;VISA&quot;, &quot;Mastercard&quot;, &quot;Discover&quot; ], [&quot;VISA&quot;, &quot;Discover&quot;]) =&gt;
    &lt;option selected&gt;VISA&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;option&gt;Mastercard&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;option selected&gt;Discover&lt;/option&gt;
</pre>
<p>
[Scott Baron]
</p>
</li>
<li>Changed the URL rewriter so controller_prefix and action_prefix can be used
in isolation. You can now do:

<pre>
  url_for(:controller_prefix =&gt; &quot;clients&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;or:
</p>
<pre>
  url_for(:action_prefix =&gt; &quot;category/messages&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
Neither would have worked in isolation before (:controller_prefix required
a :controller and :action_prefix required an :action)
</p>
</li>
<li>Started process of a cleaner separation between Action Controller and
ERb-based Action Views by introducing an abstract base class for views. And
Amita adapter could be fitted in more easily now.

</li>
<li>The date helper methods date_select and datetime_select now also use the
field error wrapping (div with class fieldWithErrors by default).

</li>
<li>The date helper methods date_select and datetime_select can now discard
selects

</li>
<li>Added option on AbstractTemplate to specify a different field error
wrapping. Example:

<pre>
  ActionView::AbstractTemplate.field_error_proc = Proc.new do |html, instance|
    &quot;&lt;p&gt;#{instance.method_name + instance.error_message}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style='background-color: red'&gt;#{html}&lt;/div&gt;&quot;
  end
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;would give the following on a Post#title (text field) error:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;p&gt;Title can't be empty&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div style='background-color: red'&gt;
    &lt;input id=&quot;post_title&quot; name=&quot;post[title]&quot; size=&quot;30&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;Hello World&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>The UrlHelper methods url_for and link_to will now by default only return
paths, not complete URIs. That should make it easier to fit a Rails
application behind a proxy or load-balancer. You can overwrite this by
passing :only_path =&gt; false as part of the options. [Suggested by U235]

</li>
<li>Fixed bug with having your own layout for use with scaffolding [Kevin
Radloff]

</li>
<li>Fixed bug where redirect_to_path didn&#8217;t append the port on
non-standard ports [dhawkins]

</li>
<li>Scaffolding plays nicely with single-table inheritance (LoadErrors are
caught) [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Scaffolding plays nice with plural models like Category/categories [Jeremy
Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed missing suffix appending in scaffolding [Kevin Radloff]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.7.9*
</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;form&quot; method now present boolean fields from PostgreSQL as
drop-down menu. [Scott]

</li>
<li>Scaffolding now automatically attempts to require the class that&#8217;s
being scaffolded.

</li>
<li>Scaffolding will use the current active layout, instead of its own, if one
has been specified. Example:

<pre>
  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    layout &quot;layouts/weblog&quot;
    scaffold :post
  end
</pre>
<p>
[Suggested by Scott]
</p>
</li>
<li>Changed url_for (and all the that drives, like redirect_to, link_to,
link_for) so you can pass it a symbol instead of a hash. This symbol is a
method reference which is then called to calculate the url. Example:

<pre>
  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    def update
      # do some update
      redirect_to :dashboard_url
    end

    protected
      def dashboard_url
        if @project.active?
          url_for :controller =&gt; &quot;project&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;dashboard&quot;
        else
          url_for :controller =&gt; &quot;account&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;dashboard&quot;
        end
      end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added default_url_options to specialize behavior for all url_for (and
friends) calls:

<pre>
  Overwrite to implement a number of default options that all url_for-based methods will use.
  The default options should come in form of a hash, just like the one you would use for
  url_for directly. Example:

    def default_url_options(options)
      { :controller_prefix =&gt; @project.active? ? &quot;projects/&quot; : &quot;accounts/&quot; }
    end

  As you can infer from the example, this is mostly useful for situations where you want to
  centralize dynamic dissions about the urls as they stem from the business domain. Please note
  that any individual url_for call can always override the defaults set by this method.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Changed url_for so that an &quot;id&quot; passed in the :params is not
treated special. You need to use the dedicated :id to get the special auto
path-params treatment. Considering the url <a
href="http://localhost:81/friends/list">localhost:81/friends/list</a>

<pre>
  url_for(:action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;, :params =&gt; { &quot;id&quot; =&gt; 5 })
    ...used to give http://localhost:81/friends/show/5
    ......now gives http://localhost:81/friends/show?id=5

  If you want the automated id behavior, do:

  url_for(:action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;, :id =&gt; 5 )
    ....which gives http://localhost:81/friends/show/5
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed problem with anchor being inserted before path parameters with
url_for (and friends)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.7.8*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed session bug where you couldn&#8217;t store any objects that
didn&#8217;t exist in the standard library (such as Active Record objects).

</li>
<li>Added reset_session method for Action Controller objects to clear out all
objects in the session.

</li>
<li>Fixed that exceptions raised during filters are now also caught by the
default rescues

</li>
<li>Added new around_filter for doing before and after filtering with a single
object [Florian Weber]:

<pre>
  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    around_filter BenchmarkingFilter.new

    # Before this action is performed, BenchmarkingFilter#before(controller) is executed
    def index
    end
    # After this action has been performed, BenchmarkingFilter#after(controller) is executed
  end

  class BenchmarkingFilter
    def initialize
      @runtime
    end

    def before
      start_timer
    end

    def after
      stop_timer
      report_result
    end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added the options for specifying a different name and id for the form
helper methods than what is guessed [Florian Weber]:

<pre>
  text_field &quot;post&quot;, &quot;title&quot;
    ...just gives: &lt;input id=&quot;post_title&quot; name=&quot;post[title]&quot; size=&quot;30&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

  text_field &quot;post&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, &quot;id&quot; =&gt; &quot;title_for_post&quot;, &quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;first_post_title&quot;
    ...can now give: &lt;input id=&quot;title_for_post&quot; name=&quot;first_post_title&quot; size=&quot;30&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added DebugHelper with a single &quot;debug&quot; method for doing pretty
dumps of objects in the view (now used in the default rescues to better
present the contents of session and template variables)

</li>
<li>Added note to log about the templates rendered within layouts (before just
the layout was shown)

</li>
<li>Fixed redirects on https setups [Andreas]

</li>
<li>Fixed scaffolding problem on the edit action when using :suffix =&gt; true
[Scott]

</li>
<li>Fixed scaffolding problem where implementing list.rhtml wouldn&#8217;t work
for the index action

</li>
<li>URLs generated now uses &amp;amp; instead of just &amp; so pages using it
can validate with W3C [Spotted by Andreas]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.7.7*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in CGI extension that prevented multipart forms from working

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.7.6*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Included ERB::Util so all templates can easily escape HTML content with
&lt;%=h @person.content %&gt;

</li>
<li>All requests are now considered local by default, so everyone will be
exposed to detailed debugging screens on errors. When the application is
ready to go public, set ActionController::Base.consider_all_requests_local
to false, and implement the protected method local_request? in the
controller to determine when debugging screens should be shown.

</li>
<li>Fixed three bugs with the url_for/redirect_to/link_to handling. Considering
the url <a
href="http://localhost:81/friends/show/1">localhost:81/friends/show/1</a>

<pre>
  url_for(:action =&gt; &quot;list&quot;)
    ...used to give http://localhost:81/friends/list/1
    ......now gives http://localhost:81/friends/list

  url_for(:controller =&gt; &quot;friends&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;destroy&quot;, :id =&gt; 5)
    ...used to give http://localhost:81/friends/destroy
    ......now gives http://localhost:81/friends/destroy/5
</pre>
<p>
Considering the url <a
href="http://localhost:81/teachers/show/t">localhost:81/teachers/show/t</a>
</p>
<pre>
  url_for(:action =&gt; &quot;list&quot;, :id =&gt; 5)
    ...used to give http://localhost:81/5eachers/list/t
    ......now gives http://localhost:81/teachers/list/5
</pre>
