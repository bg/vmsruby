module Mail
  
  # = Body
  # 
  # The body is where the text of the email is stored.  Mail treats the body
  # as a single object.  The body itself has no information about boundaries
  # used in the MIME standard, it just looks at it's content as either a single
  # block of text, or (if it is a multipart message) as an array of blocks o text.
  # 
  # A body has to be told to split itself up into a multipart message by calling
  # #split with the correct boundary.  This is because the body object has no way
  # of knowing what the correct boundary is for itself (there could be many
  # boundaries in a body in the case of a nested MIME text).
  # 
  # Once split is called, Mail::Body will slice itself up on this boundary,
  # assigning anything that appears before the first part to the preamble, and
  # anything that appears after the closing boundary to the epilogue, then
  # each part gets initialized into a Mail::Part object.
  # 
  # The boundary that is used to split up the Body is also stored in the Body
  # object for use on encoding itself back out to a string.  You can 
  # overwrite this if it needs to be changed.
  # 
  # On encoding, the body will return the preamble, then each part joined by
  # the boundary, followed by a closing boundary string and then the epilogue.
